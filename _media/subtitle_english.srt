1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,267
So "Oh boy I sure do love being perceived

2
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,067
as a gifted child, I hope I don't end up

3
00:00:04,068 --> 00:00:06,933
as being a perfectionist... perfectionist

4
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:07,900
burnout with...

5
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:09,967
burnt out I suppose, with depression,

6
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,030
anxiety, unfulfilled expectations

7
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:13,333
and no real interests or goals".

8
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:16,000
So this is something that someone

9
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,065
cross-posted to our subreddit, you know

10
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:19,433
it's a meme. We've had a couple of

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,860
streams about burnout and gifted kids,
so today what I'd like to talk to you

12
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:27,767
all a little bit about is

13
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:33,031
the pathway from gifted child to burnt

14
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,100
out perfectionist

15
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,933
as well as sort of the way that society

16
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:39,600
actually sets gifted children up 

17
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:40,866
to kind of fail

18
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:42,900
So I know it's kind of interesting, but

19
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,033
when we think about a gifted child

20
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:47,567
we think about we perceive

21
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:49,067
gifted as an advantage

22
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:51,300
but in my experience working with a lot

23
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,467
of gifted children, it's not always an

24
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:54,900
advantage and in fact often times

25
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:55,833
it can be a burden,

26
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:58,167
and so I've seen this a lot in our

27
00:00:58,168 --> 00:00:59,100
community I've worked with a lot of

28
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,533
people who kind of fall into that this category,

29
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:02,767
I suppose I sort of fall 

30
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:03,733
into it as well.

31
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:06,967
Where I grew up kind of... I'm gifted, right?

32
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:08,500
So like school was easy for me, I

33
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,733
was told from a very young age 

34
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:10,567
that I was smart,

35
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:13,400
I was also kind of held accountable for

36
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:16,100
like... not studying, right? There like I'd

37
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,800
kind of like not study very much and

38
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:21,167
maybe get a B+ or an A-.

39
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:23,733
And my teachers would tell my parents

40
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:25,267
the same thing every single

41
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:26,590
parent-teacher conference, they'd always

42
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:28,333
say "well, if Alok look just applied

43
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:30,500
himself he would be the best 

44
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:31,200
student in the class",

45
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:33,967
"If he only just like studied more 

46
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:34,833
he'd be the best student in

47
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:36,000
the class", right, they were like "He's

48
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:38,000
super smart, he has a lot of potential",

49
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:39,867
right, so they use these words like... 

50
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:41,933
they talk about how smart I am, they talk

51
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:43,667
about all the potential I have, and if I

52
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:45,765
just applied myself I'd be you know... 

53
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:46,933
I'd be such a...

54
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:48,267
I'd be the best student.

55
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:50,500
So it's kind of interesting because we

56
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,767
perceive giftedness as an advantage,

57
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:55,200
but as one of my teachers once told me

58
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:56,125
we'll kind of get to 

59
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:56,867
this towards the end,

60
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:59,467
they once explained to me that um... this

61
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:01,900
is in... in... not in medical school, but when

62
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:03,133
I was training to become a psychiatrist,

63
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:04,533
I had a supervisor who once told me that

64
00:02:04,534 --> 00:02:06,967
gifted... gifted children are special needs

65
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:08,900
children and what that literally means

66
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:11,667
is that like the needs of a child who's

67
00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:13,664
gifted are actually different from the

68
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:15,667
average child, and the parents who

69
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,900
recognize that and recognize that this

70
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:19,731
child is going to need like a slightly

71
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:20,767
different structure, a different

72
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:22,333
curriculum or a different way of being

73
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,267
raised, are the ones that end up sort of

74
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:26,767
doing a really good job, and oddly enough

75
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:29,067
in her clinical experience she found

76
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:30,533
that much like any other

77
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,533
special needs children um...

78
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:34,900
you know, kids that were not

79
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:38,629
treated... appropriately, despite their

80
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,390
gifts, were the ones that kind of

81
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:42,467
struggled. So this statement, when I first

82
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:44,990
heard it, I thought was like absolutely

83
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:45,433
ridiculous, kind of  blew my mind a little

84
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,395
bit, but I respected the supervisor a lot

85
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:48,667
and I started thinking about it.

86
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,800
So what I'd like to share with you all

87
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:52,767
today is sort of the pathway 

88
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:55,067
that a gifted child takes,

89
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:57,533
how a society treats them, how parents

90
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,267
treat them, the kind of struggles they

91
00:02:59,268 --> 00:03:00,967
face, or the influences that they have,

92
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:02,100
let's not even call it a struggle

93
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:03,867
because it may not be a struggle and

94
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:05,467
then sort of how they end up. So I'd like

95
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:06,830
to kind of share with... that with 

96
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:07,733
you all today, okay?

97
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:10,400
So the first thing that tends to happen

98
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:13,167
is when a child is gifted they te...

99
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:15,267
school tends to be easy, right? 

100
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:16,000
So if you kind of think 

101
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,500
about it developmentally,

102
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:18,933
there are a lot of different things that

103
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,700
happen in school, so let's talk about

104
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,667
school. So school is a place where you

105
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,733
get... you socialize, right? So you get

106
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:26,900
socialization skills, it's a place that

107
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:28,433
you learn and people think that school

108
00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:30,065
is primarily about learning, and it is

109
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,330
primarily about learning, 

110
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:32,233
but it's just not about

111
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,233
learning that the subject material, 

112
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:36,767
so sure we learn like arithmetic and

113
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:38,200
mathematics and all that kind of stuff,

114
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,600
we learn history and science 

115
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:40,767
and all that good stuff,

116
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:42,695
but really school if you kind of 

117
00:03:42,696 --> 00:03:44,333
look at it developmentally, is a wonderful

118
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:46,833
opportunity to learn certain key things,

119
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:49,900
socialization is a really important piece,

120
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,367
the other thing is like habits and

121
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,433
how to study, and this is the first sort

122
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,667
of disadvantage that I think 

123
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,900
gifted children sort of face,

124
00:03:56,901 --> 00:03:59,098
is that you know if you're young and

125
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,667
you're gifted, school is so easy that you

126
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:04,067
sort of get by without the luxury of

127
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:06,600
studying and so we kind of perceive this

128
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:08,067
as an advantage, right, like if you have

129
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:09,567
to if you go through school and you

130
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:11,367
don't study like that's easy like 

131
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:12,867
it's easy easy clap, right?

132
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:14,795
And so it is and that 

133
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:15,900
sort of makes sense,

134
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:18,067
but the... the interesting thing that I

135
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:19,867
found is that oftentimes being

136
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:22,265
intelligent, especially when you're super

137
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:24,730
young as a kid, actually sets you up for

138
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,033
failure down the road, because 

139
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:28,267
you never need to learn

140
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:32,300
the habituated study like technique,

141
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:33,767 
that you kind of need to that...

142
00:04:33,768 --> 00:04:35,367
that you need to succeed later on. 

143
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:37,430
So for a normal kid what tends to happen is

144
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:38,400
like they don't have to study like in

145
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:39,867
first grade, but maybe like second grade

146
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:41,600
third grade, they have to learn how to

147
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:43,833
study like once a week, maybe they like

148
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:45,133
learn how to study the night before the

149
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:46,000
test because it doesn't 

150
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,100
come easily to them

151
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:49,333
and then fourth grade fifth grade, now

152
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:50,795
you're... you're doing homework a couple

153
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:52,500
days a week, you know, you're studying two

154
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,467
or three days before the test, then you

155
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:55,933
kind of hit middle school, where maybe

156
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:57,300
you're studying like four days before

157
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:58,833
the test, and so there's this very

158
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:01,300
graduated sense of increasing

159
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,130
responsibility as you go further 

160
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,067
and further in school

161
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:06,567
and it's sort of designed that way, right?

162
00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:09,667
We're not... like no teacher has a six... six year 

163
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:11,167
old that they're like... giving 

164
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,467
fourteen hours of homework a week to, it's just

165
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:15,830
absurd, and then at the top end of the

166
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:17,567
spectrum in terms of study habits and

167
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,900
what we demand of students, you have

168
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,333
something like let's say law school or

169
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:21,933
medical school or things like that, where

170
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:24,100
people are regularly studying like sixty 

171
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,933
hours a week, eighty hours a week in medical

172
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:28,700
school because you know people have... have

173
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,533
grown up and have built enough of a

174
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:32,500
study habit where they can actually

175
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:33,800
handle that pace of study.

176
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,700
So what happens with the gifted kid, so

177
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:38,933
the gifted kid you know, when you sort of

178
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:41,533
level up your skill to level one like in

179
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:42,967
the first grade and then you level up

180
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,330
your studying skill to level two in the

181
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:45,300
second grade and level three in the

182
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,733
third grade. So the gifted kid never

183
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:50,533
actually has to like grind that xp for

184
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:51,800
levels like one through five 

185
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:52,667
of studying habits

186
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:55,533
and so they sort of managed to get Bs

187
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:57,333
or As without really minimal with

188
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:59,000
minimal studying or no studying at all,

189
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,333
and then seventh grade rolls around

190
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,000
eighth grade rolls around, they start to

191
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,360
struggle a little bit maybe they get Bs,

192
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,280
they're still not learning how to study

193
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,639
because they sort of skipped that part of ...

194
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,400
of the you know... the skill building

195
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,919
and we'll kind of get to that later, 

196
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,360
and then what tends to happen with gifted

197
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,720
kids is that they don't need to study,

198
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,160
don't need to study, don't need to study.

199
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
And then they hit a wall,

200
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,639
they finally get into some kind of

201
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
situation where their 

202
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,319
raw intellect cannot...

203
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,000
is no longer sufficient to handle the

204
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,880
schoolwork that they're 

205
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,639
supposed to handle,

206
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,639
but they've trained themselves at that

207
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,680
point, they've customized themselves at

208
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,880
that point to managing 

209
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,479
school with raw intellect,

210
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,479
and so when that kind of falls short

211
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,000
they like they really kind of really hit

212
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,120
a wall, it's a very very 

213
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,639
hard cliff to to overcome,

214
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,400
and so this is kind of the first thing

215
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,479
that that sort of shoots gifted kids in

216
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,240
the foot and this also leads to kind of

217
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,599
this idea of perfectionism and burnout,

218
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,039
because then they like you know then

219
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,720
they... they struggle a lot, they don't

220
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,160
understand why they can't do it, they...

221
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,199
they try, they know they're smart,

222
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,120
everyone's talking to them about

223
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,120
potential, they start to feel really bad

224
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,880
about themselves. So the first kind of

225
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,199
interesting thing that gifted kids run

226
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,520
into is the fact that they sort of don't

227
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,720
develop the proper study habits, because

228
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,639
you know as a six-year-old it's kind of

229
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,080
not your fault, because like you're not

230
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,479
mature enough as a six-year-old to

231
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,720
realize, like "Oh I need you know to have

232
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,400
good study habits. So even though the

233
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,599
teacher said this last tuesday and I

234
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
understand that I don't need to study,

235
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,240
I'm going to sit down and like practice

236
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,639
my study habits". It doesn't make any

237
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,560
sense, it's like completely artificial,

238
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,639
so that's the first thing that happens,

239
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,720
is that they kind of hit this wall of... of

240
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,319
you know not being able to study.

241
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,720
The second thing to consider is the

242
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,800
expectation, so another thing that really

243
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,479
leads gifted kids kind of

244
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,639
down the wrong path, is the burden 

245
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,080
of expectation that's placed

246
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,440
upon them, so from a very young age

247
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,039
they're told "Oh you're gifted", "You're

248
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,199
smart", "You're special", "You have so much

249
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,720
potential", and so what that starts to do,

250
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,960
is it constructs like a very very lofty

251
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,639
goal in their minds, right. So I'm going

252
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,440
to use kind of an analogy which is kind

253
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,280
of like... you know if I think about an

254
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,440
amazing home, like I think about a

255
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,919
mansion, it can have a beautiful

256
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,680
blueprint and I can buy a gigantic piece

257
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,919
of land, and I can look at that and I can

258
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,400
say like "Oh... like this... this home or this...

259
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,240
this blueprint has so much potential".

260
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,280
And sometimes we kind 

261
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,400
of forget that like, you can

262
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,639
have like... you can have a

263
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,840
blueprint for a mansion, but that's gonna

264
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,479
actually take way more work to achieve

265
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,000
than like building a shack. So the other

266
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,000
really interesting thing that... that we

267
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
sort of kind of get wrong societally, is

268
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,759
that we assume that 

269
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,279
when someone is gifted,

270
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,760
things are actually going to be easier

271
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,919
for them, that they need to work less to

272
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,839
accomplish the same amount,

273
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,800
but in my experience living up to a

274
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,720
gifted child's potential involves more

275
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,080
work, it's sort of like you know it's

276
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,160
just like building a shack versus

277
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,720
building a mansion, like sure the mansion

278
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,040
is capable of so much more than the shack

279
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,040
is capable of, but let's not forget for a

280
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,760
moment, that the amount of effort that it

281
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,680
goes into building a mansion is actually

282
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,440
way more than what's required to build a

283
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,880
shack. This is the second place that

284
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
gifted kids kind of get tripped up,

285
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,839
because everyone around

286
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,640
is looking at them and 

287
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,720
they're sort of saying

288
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,560
"Oh like this is an amazing mansion", like

289
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,399
"You could build such an amazing mansion".

290
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,000
And we all kind of forget for a moment

291
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,160
that like... actually living up to that

292
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,640
potential is very very difficult and

293
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,880
requires a lot more of an investment,

294
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,200
than building a shack.

295
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,279
And so this gap between what people

296
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,519
expect of you and also the idea that

297
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,160
things should be easier for you,

298
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,080
kind of compound on themselves and sort

299
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,680
of end up with gifted kids kind of

300
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,880
feeling like they're... they're failing at

301
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,399
everything, right? Because 

302
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,000
they have all this potential

303
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,360
and they're not they're 

304
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,640
just not living up to it.

305
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,880
So the other thing that we'll see in

306
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,800
gifted kids is that, what... what tends to

307
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,640
happen is that they will put 

308
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,519
in some amount of work,

309
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,519
but they're expecting a mansion, when

310
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,880
all they've really put in is 

311
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,240
as much as building a shack.

312
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,000
I may have lost you a little bit there,

313
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,720
but let me just explain,

314
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
so you know what a

315
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,600
gifted kid will do is

316
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,040
they'll like look at their peers, right,

317
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,720
and they'll say like "Oh like this person

318
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,399
did this and they're able to accomplish

319
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,399
this, so like I should be able to do that too"

320
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,600
and so if you look at your neighbors

321
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,040
who are building a shack and they're

322
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,519
like whoa they went to *Leroy Merlin* and

323
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,519
they got like a hundred pounds of wood, and

324
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,200
they built their shack over a weekend,

325
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,880
and then like you go and get your a hundred 

326
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,200
pounds of wood from *Leroy Merlin* and you

327
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,680
start like... brought to you by *Leroy Merlin*,

328
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,600
I suppose, um... and you start building your

329
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,279
mansion like... I know it sounds kind of

330
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,720
weird, but you know a hundred pounds of wood

331
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,720
may be enough to build a shack, but it's

332
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,000
nowhere near enough to build a mansion.

333
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,519
And then what gifted kids will do is

334
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,800
they'll look at like the foundation that

335
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,640
they've laid with a hundred pounds of

336
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,399
wood, and they'll be like "Where's the..."

337
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,160
"I don't even have a shack" like you know

338
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
it's... it's like they look at what they've

339
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,440
accomplished, when they put in the same

340
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,880
amount of energy as someone else, and

341
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,880
they get really confused because this

342
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,560
person has a complete shack over here

343
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,800
and like I have like barely the

344
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,560
beginnings of a mansion. And so then that

345
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,240
sort of negatively impacts them, they

346
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,680
start to like feel like they're actually

347
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,040
inferior to these other people, because

348
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,640
they've been told "Oh you're smarter than

349
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,160
the kid next door", like "Why the hell is

350
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,200
the kid next door getting into college

351
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,360
and like you're not even getting into

352
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,519
college" and so it all sort of... sort of...

353
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,200
sort of compounds, right, because even for

354
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,480
the gifted kid, they're not trying to

355
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,839
build a shack, because they've been told...

356
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,240
they've been... they're gifted their entire

357
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,079
life. So it's not enough to be average if

358
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,600
you're gifted, so what you have to do is

359
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,120
you try to, you know, build a mansion,

360
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,440
because that's what you've been

361
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,519
told... that you're capable of, that's the

362
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,720
expectation you set for yourself. And

363
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,240
then you're... you're left kind of

364
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,079
scratching your head and wondering like

365
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,079
why you don't even have a shack yet, even

366
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,680
though you studied for a month and they

367
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,000
studied for a month, you're not getting

368
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,440
as much as that they're getting,

369
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,640
and it's kind of super bizarre, right?

370
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,160
Because we don't we just don't think

371
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,760
about it that way, we think that if

372
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,839
you're gifted that means that everything

373
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,839
should be easier for you, that it not

374
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,360
only they may need a hundred pounds of

375
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,800
wood to build a shack, but you should be

376
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,120
able to build a shack with 50 pounds of

377
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,680
wood, it should be easier for you, but it

378
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,000
turns out paradoxically being harder.

379
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,279
And then we sort of end up with kind of

380
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,600
the final state of a gifted kid, which if

381
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,600
we kind of think about it internally, is

382
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,760
a state of like really shame and low

383
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,360
self-esteem. So all this stuff kind of

384
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,360
compounds, right? Like you're told you're

385
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,680
smart, so you set this expectation of

386
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,360
what you're capable of, like way up here,

387
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,200
and then like you know first grade goes

388
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,800
by and you're up here, second grade goes

389
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,320
by and you're up here, third grade goes

390
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,000
by and you're up here, boom, boom, boom,

391
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,480
fourth grade, fifth grade, sixth grade,

392
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,279
tenth grade eleventh grade and then you kind

393
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
of tank, right, and as you go to college

394
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,959
suddenly like you don't have the study

395
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,440
skills involved, and now in the gap

396
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,240
between what you're capable of and what

397
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,079
you actually accomplish, this gap is

398
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,639
where shame comes from this, is the shame

399
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,440
gap that gifted kids

400
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,959
inevitably fall into,

401
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,040
which is when they fall short of what

402
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,560
their expectations are, and 

403
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,160
this could be once again

404
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,000
due to the fact that you're... you know

405
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,320
you're setting out to build a mansion

406
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,240
and you ended up not even building a

407
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,800
shack, right? So all of these

408
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,399
discrepancies between your expectations

409
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,720
and your accomplishments

410
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,639
in that gap, and the bigger the gap is,

411
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,639
the more it's filled with shame,

412
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,480
so then what happens is kids are ashamed,

413
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,320
right? Because they should be doing more,

414
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,320
they should be doing better

415
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,000
and then like the shame then further

416
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,600
compounds and makes it hard to find

417
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,360
motivation and this is where you kind of

418
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,720
get burnout. So then like you have these

419
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,000
gifted kids and you're like "Hey man just

420
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,360
like go to a community college, you don't

421
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,639
have to go to an ivy league school...

422
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,560
school, you don't have to go to like

423
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,880
Harvard or Stanford or MIT. Just like go

424
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,720
to your local community college" and in

425
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,320
that comes a bunch of shame, because

426
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,560
you've been told your entire life that

427
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,959
you're better than that, right?

428
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,519
And so you start to develop this ego

429
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,760
of being a super smart kid, and then this

430
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,440
leads to avoidance of things, because all

431
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,519
you're left with is the identity of a

432
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,959
smart kid, so you can never even bring

433
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,680
yourself to go to community college,

434
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,519
because smart kids don't go to community

435
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,360
college. In your mind that's where the

436
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,880
stupid kids go and if you go to

437
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,720
community college then suddenly, you've

438
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,240
lived your entire life for 20 years

439
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,680
being told you're a smart kid, it's the

440
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,959
only... that's your biggest strength, it's

441
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,720
the one that everyone keeps talking

442
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,360
about, and now like suddenly you have to

443
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,519
relegate yourself to being a stupid kid

444
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,440
and in that gap is where the shame lives,

445
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,000
in that gap is where the ego lives, okay?

446
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,279
So it's really really hard, right? Because

447
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,519
you're set up with these expectations,

448
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,760
people don't really acknowledge that...

449
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,120
because you're capable of a lot, it's

450
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,920
actually going to take like a lot of

451
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,279
work to take that potential 

452
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,880
and bring it to fruition,

453
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,480
right? And that's like... that's the biggest

454
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,480
thing is, people just lose sight of the

455
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,560
fact that building a mansion actually

456
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,399
takes more work than building a shack,

457
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,760
and your entire life people have told

458
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,639
you like you should build this mansion

459
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,000
because that's what you're capable of.

460
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,600
And so then we kind of get to "All right,

461
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,800
so like what do we do about it?", right, so

462
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,639
if you're a gifted kid who's kind of

463
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,720
perfectionistic and burnt out, and like

464
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,920
society has sort of set you up this way.

465
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,760
I'm not saying that you're not

466
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,760
individually responsible as well, but I

467
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,480
do think that there's a whole reason so

468
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,880
when we have like a generation of burnt

469
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,639
out gifted kids, I think we have to be

470
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,399
fair and be a little bit scientific and

471
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,720
kind of acknowledge that this may not be

472
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,639
like an individual problem, right? We've

473
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,240
got a generation of kids like this, like

474
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,880
maybe there's something societal going

475
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,839
on and I think paradoxically we sort of

476
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,120
set these kids up to

477
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,360
struggle, and so then the question

478
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,000
becomes "Okay, like what do we do about it?"

479
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,480
So the first thing you should do if

480
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,440
you're a gifted kid is to stop

481
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,199
comparison, right? Like comparison is... is

482
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,240
the foundation of getting 

483
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,920
out of this problem,

484
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,680
because as long as you are comparing

485
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,120
yourself and this is part of the issue

486
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,320
is that if you think 

487
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,399
about the word gifted,

488
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,800
what does the word gifted imply, it is a

489
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,199
word that has no meaning

490
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,199
outside of a comparative framework, you

491
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,040
guys get that? The only way you can be

492
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,639
gifted is if there are other 

493
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,560
people who are not gifted,

494
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,920
and so essentially what happens is like

495
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,800
the whole idea of a gifted kid only

496
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,639
exists in relationship to another kid,

497
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,720
and so what we find in the minds of

498
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,399
gifted kids is that they're comparing

499
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,759
themselves all the time "Oh I don't want

500
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,600
to go to community college that's where

501
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,040
the stupid people go", "Oh I don't know

502
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,199
like why I can't do what my friend is

503
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,040
capable of like, he's able to do so much

504
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,759
why am I not able to do so much?" "I have

505
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,079
an older sibling who did fantastic

506
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,079
and now I have big shoes to fill", right?

507
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,040
There's so much comparison, all of the

508
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,720
expectations that gifted kids have don't

509
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,560
come from themselves, right?

510
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,880
Because if you actually based your

511
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,800
expectations on what you're capable of,

512
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,240
you'd be capable of A, B, C, D, or an F,

513
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,480
that's what that would be a realistic

514
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,320
expectation, but instead you create these

515
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,399
artificial expectations that are based

516
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,360
on comparison and why do gifted kids do

517
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,600
that? Because it starts with their

518
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,839
parents, it starts with their teachers.

519
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,079
We're all told that we're gifted, which

520
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,680
is by definition a comparison 

521
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,800
to all of the other kids,

522
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,720
and so then what happens is you're

523
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,560
looking over at the shack, and you've got

524
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,160
this blueprint for a mansion and they

525
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,519
give you some wood and then you try to

526
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,440
build the mansion and like you don't

527
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,120
even have a roof, when this person has a

528
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,800
completely built shack, and then you kind

529
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,880
of look at yourself well like "Man I must

530
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,800
be like a super idiot", right like and

531
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,240
it's just it's so bizarre that when we

532
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,320
set up this kind of... when we start with

533
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,240
this framework of a comparison,

534
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,000
we sort of doom ourselves to failure,

535
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,759
because there's like... we're just...

536
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,920
it's just it's never going to work,

537
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,240
because you can't ever

538
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,920
base the expectations of your life and

539
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,600
what you're capable of based on what

540
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,000
someone else is doing, right?

541
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,520
If someone else is happy studying

542
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,799
chemical engineering it doesn't mean

543
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,039
that you're going to be happy studying

544
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,799
chemical engineering. If somebody else is

545
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,839
happy dating someone of the opposite sex

546
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,160
it doesn't mean that you're going to be

547
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,000
happy dating someone of the opposite sex.

548
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,240
The whole point is as individuals, as

549
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,520
humans we're individuals and if you're a

550
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,360
gifted kid the first thing you've got to

551
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,839
do is let go of all comparison.

552
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,079
So next thing is to

553
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,919
recognize that your road is going to be

554
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,559
a rough one, right? So like when someone

555
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,400
sets out to build a mansion, they know in

556
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,840
their mind that like: "This is 

557
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,480
gonna take a while", right?

558
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,919
You can't expect to build a mansion in

559
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,520
the same amount of time it would take

560
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,120
someone to build a shack,

561
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,520
and so if you're a gifted kid and you

562
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,640
expect a lot 

563
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,240
from yourself, okay?

564
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,799
Recognize that this is going to be a

565
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,960
long road and the greater your potential

566
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,640
is the longer it's going to take for you

567
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,720
to get there, and this is something that

568
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,360
I can understand in hindsight, like so I

569
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,840
grew up as a gifted kid and was like in

570
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,600
you know the special classes or whatever,

571
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,760
I actually still remember when I was in

572
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,480
eighth grade my grades started to dip

573
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,440
and when i went to high school

574
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,200
um... I didn't qualify for... based on my

575
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,120
grades like my high school was like "Yeah

576
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,799
he needs to be in like regular english,

577
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,840
he can't be in like advanced english" or

578
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,919
"He doesn't meet the criteria for

579
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,280
advanced english and so my parents were

580
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,880
really really not happy with that,

581
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,120
because they have... they have such a smart

582
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,559
boy you know "He's so smart, he just needs

583
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,919
to apply himself", so they went to the

584
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,000
school and I remember having a meeting

585
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,600
with the... the... honors english teacher or

586
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,799
whatever and then he's like "Do you want

587
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,919
to be in this class and I was like "Yeah, 

588
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,679
I want to be in the class" and my parents

589
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,520
were like "Yeah he should be..." "He belongs,

590
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,880
he belongs in the class",

591
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,720
right? And so the teacher was like "Okay,

592
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,240
fine", because you know...

593
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,600
I mean you're not gonna... you know there

594
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,679
are some parents that could potentially

595
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,960
be annoying, so you're like whatever

596
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,400
and so I ended up being in the class

597
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,760
that I really didn't belong to

598
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,880
and I really didn't do very well,

599
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,679
right? because I didn't have the work

600
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,799
ethic, but it propagates sort of this

601
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,799
idea of like you can handle it,

602
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,880
so like I started off you know going on

603
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,320
the wrong track kind of like in... in high

604
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,000
school it took me...

605
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,760
I... took me five years to graduate 

606
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,600
from college right with a 2.5 gpa,

607
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,840
took me another three or four years to

608
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,559
even get into medical school,

609
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,400
and so like my road has been long

610
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,640
and like that's just sometimes what it

611
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
takes if you're a gifted kid, right?

612
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,640
You take the scenic route in life, so

613
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,440
oftentimes people would 

614
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,720
ask me you know like

615
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,320
about stuff, when I remember 

616
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,840
when I was going to.. when

617
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,360
I started medical school and I saw

618
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,559
friends of mine right who were... who I was

619
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,799
in high school with, they're already

620
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,240
fully trained doctors and you know

621
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,280
flying around, and all that good stuff,

622
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,400
and I'm just like starting medical

623
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,039
school, and I was like "Yeah I took the

624
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
scenic route in life". And so recognize

625
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,240
that if you're a gifted kid, like it's a

626
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,080
long road, like you're not going to do

627
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,280
things faster, you're not 

628
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,280
going to build a mansion

629
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,799
as fast as someone else is going to

630
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,799
build a shack. The other thing to

631
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,600
recognize about it being a long road if

632
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,480
you're a gifted kid, is don't expect to

633
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,520
see the form of your 

634
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,039
mansion for a long time,

635
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,120
when other people have built their

636
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,440
shacks you will still just have the

637
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,960
foundation of the mansion, it's not going

638
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,480
to have a roof for a long time, it's not

639
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,679
going to have windows for a long time. So

640
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,960
this is the other problem 

641
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,200
that gifted kids run into,

642
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,440
is as they put in an equal amount of

643
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,760
effort compared to their colleagues, they

644
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,400
actually see less return on their

645
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,080
investment, and that in turn shatters

646
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,280
their motivation and what 

647
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,559
makes them want to give up,

648
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,480
right? Because "I'm putting in all this

649
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,640
effort, I'm still not seeing anything yet",

650
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,159
so it's a long road. Be patient with

651
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,240
yourself and try your best not to

652
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,000
compare to other people.

653
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,240
The last thing to kind of consider is

654
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,760
that... is the shame, so gifted kids

655
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,360
oftentimes struggle a lot with

656
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,120
self-esteem and shame, and that once

657
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,200
again is because their expectations are

658
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,720
up here and their 

659
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,200
performance is down here, right?

660
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,640
And so in that gap is where 

661
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,640
your shame is going to live

662
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,400
and so as long as there is a gap in what

663
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,880
you expect from yourself,

664
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,280
with what you accomplish,

665
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,039
you will have shame, and the solution to

666
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,840
that oddly enough is one 

667
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,679
of two ways, right?

668
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,360
One is you can actually

669
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,280
live up to the expectations that you

670
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,120
have, right, so you can actually shoot up

671
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,440
here and land up here, so you can go to

672
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,200
an ivy league school or whatever, right?

673
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,120
You can go, you can start...

674
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,559
you can do a tech startup 

675
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,480
or whatever, like... you can like

676
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,000
do everything that everyone has always

677
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,080
known you're capable of doing, so you can

678
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,080
actually hit all of those metrics, that's

679
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,080
one option, then the shame will go away

680
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,600
or what you can do  

681
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,679
is let go of your expectations

682
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,240
and bring yourself down here, because the

683
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,720
shame exists in the gap so even if you

684
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,280
accept yourself as being like sort of a

685
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,400
failure, oddly enough the shame will go

686
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,039
away and as you accept yourself as you

687
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,120
are, which is not wasted potential, but

688
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,720
like in the present, like you are

689
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,320
everything that you're capable of.

690
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,320
Everything that you've ever been capable

691
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,720
of is exactly what you've achieved and

692
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,960
once you sort of take that attitude,

693
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,799
bring your expectations down to here you,

694
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,320
will be amazed at like what happens to

695
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,679
your motivation and what 

696
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,600
you are truly capable of,

697
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,159
but you can't achieve it as long as

698
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,039
there is that shame gap, right? Like in

699
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,000
terms of performance. So questions.

700
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,240
anyway so let me just kind of summarize,

701
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
so I think that like

702
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,520
you know we see this a lot 

703
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,280
where a lot of people are gifted

704
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,280
and we think of that as an advantage, but

705
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,720
like I was saying 

706
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,440
earlier I think that...

707
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,240
you know sometimes being gifted comes

708
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,240
with its own set of needs

709
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,600
and by properly addressing those needs

710
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,679
we can avoid some of these things, like

711
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,080
gifted kids you know feeling

712
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,559
ashamed of themselves, gifted kids

713
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,480
you know not like comparing themselves

714
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,720
to like all the other normal kids and

715
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,880
and finding themselves lacking,

716
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,559
um... and also that we have to kind of

717
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,880
acknowledge that our school system is

718
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,600
sort of set up in a particular way, that

719
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,440
oftentimes causes gifted kids to stumble

720
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,679
and through understanding like how a

721
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,840
gifted kid, you know a child who is

722
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,919
gifted, becomes an adult who's

723
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,679
perfectionistic and burnt out.

724
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,520
We have to understand that whole life

725
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,120
cycle in order to sort of start taking steps 

726
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,120
to change it. Um... okay "So I'm sure you've been 

727
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,720
asked this question before and have answered before,

728
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,480
so feel free to tell me where I can

729
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,919
finally answer this question. How are you

730
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,360
able to get accepted to harvard medical

731
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,919
school, let alone medical school alone

732
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,679
with such a low gpa when that is such a

733
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,039
critical deciding factor?

734
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,760
How did i stand out?" So that's a great

735
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,679
question, so the short answer is so I... I

736
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,159
did some amount of graduate education, so

737
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,600
I did a master's degree to boost my gpa.

738
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,000
The second thing that I did, I didn't go

739
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,400
to harvard for medical school I went to

740
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,320
Tufts for medical school and then I did

741
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,960
my psychiatry training at Harvard, at

742
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,640
Mass General Mclean Hospital.

743
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,559
And so the short answer of like how I

744
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,520
wound up there is 

745
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,679
like one step at a time,

746
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,279
so you have to do you know in each of

747
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,279
those things involved like a reality check or some degree of

748
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,240
humility in terms of like thinking, like

749
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,520
"I actually don't belong at harvard" like

750
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,440
"I'm never going to wind up there", I had

751
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,720
to accept that, right? Let alone 

752
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,559
get into medical school,

753
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,080
and the more that I accepted like... I... 

754
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,159
I did a lot of things, that were you know,

755
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,080
humbling to say the least, I wouldn't

756
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,000
quite say undignified, but I had to

757
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,760
really let go of a lot of ego and like

758
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,919
take one step at a time. It also took

759
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,200
perseverance, I mean I applied to one hundred   

760
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,279
twenty medical schools before I got into a

761
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,159
single one and that was the 

762
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,000
break that I needed, and then

763
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,880
like understanding, having all

764
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,039
that failure behind me, I really

765
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,520
worked hard in medical school

766
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,840
and really tried to excel,

767
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,279
and then I actually did an away rotation,

768
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,600
for those of you don't know what that is

769
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,520
or for those of you do know what that is,

770
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,640
so I basically did an audition rotation

771
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,320
at Harvard, which is like super

772
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,600
competitive, you show up there with a

773
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,919
bunch of other people who want to go

774
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,520
there and it's basically like a test,

775
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,000
it's like a month-long test of what

776
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,840
you're capable of, and I did really well,

777
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,159
so thankfully I had set up you know a

778
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,279
lot of good stuff over 

779
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,600
the last eight years

780
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,120
in terms of being myself and like owning

781
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,960
the person that I was, and not being

782
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,720
ashamed of the fact that I failed,

783
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,400
and you know recognizing that most of

784
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,240
the students most of the other students

785
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,080
who were auditioning... um... 

786
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,840
were four years younger than I was,

787
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,440
that I was actually older 

788
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,880
than some of the residents there,

789
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,880
despite the fact that like they were

790
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,960
evaluating me, right? So like there's

791
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,400
someone two years younger 

792
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,919
who's like giving me a grade,

793
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,840
so navigating all that stuff was

794
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,679
difficult, but I did a good job at it and

795
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,440
stayed focused and that's how I wound up

796
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,880
at harvard. So I trained there for four years and that's where  

797
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm faculty now... right? but it's all about like letting go of the ego.

798
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,279
Um... "How do you lower expectations?", uh... you 

799
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,679
lower expectations by accepting what you're capable of,

800
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,600
like actually. And so expectation and... and

801
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,880
acceptance are at opposite 

802
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,919
ends of the spectrum,

803
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,919
okay? So

804
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,279
practicing acceptance 

805
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,840
is how you

806
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,600
lower expectations, so let me

807
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,440
give you guys an example, so

808
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,440
the theme today is Jnana Yoga,

809
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,559
right? So like let me think about a Jnana 

810
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,799
Yoga exercise to let go of expectations.

811
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,799
Um... let me just think about this for a second...

812
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,080
so here's a good example of a Jana Yoga

813
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,240
exercise, actually I don't know 

814
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,840
if this is a good example,

815
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,600
this is one of the ones that I feel less

816
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,679
confident this is maybe a 

817
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,120
bad example of a Jnana  Yoga 

818
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,960
exercise, so for the next

819
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,720
month or two months when you go to a restaurant, 

820
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,720
and someone asks you what you want to...

821
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,000
want... what you want to order just tell

822
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,080
the waiter to surprise you,

823
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,320
just tell them "Surprise me",

824
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,760
and then pay attention

825
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,400
to your enjoyment or lack 

826
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,880
of enjoyment of the food,

827
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,120
right? So when we go to restaurants,

828
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,720
we have expectations and 

829
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,559
if we think about the least...

830
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,640
the worst experience that you can have

831
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,840
at a restaurant is not 

832
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,080
actually to have bad food,

833
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,520
it's to expect really good food and get

834
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,799
bad food, that's actually worse than

835
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,480
getting bad food. If you know a

836
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,600
restaurant is crap and you go there, and

837
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,440
you order something, the food that you

838
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,279
get is crap like what were you expecting,

839
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,720
it's totally fine actually, right? We do

840
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,480
that every day, like if you go to a fast

841
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,799
food like McDonald's or Taco Bell or

842
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,320
whatever, like you're not expecting you

843
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,480
know like a gourmet meal, you're just

844
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,080
expecting some like 

845
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,120
mediocre, arguably incredibly tasty,

846
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,799
depending on whether you're getting a

847
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,159
mexican pizza or not,

848
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,279
which you can't 

849
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,240
get anymore because 

850
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,039
they're out of sad,

851
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,960
But... so like a lot of...

852
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,559
if you guys want to

853
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,320
really understand, so this is the way

854
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,600
that Jnana Yoga works, if you really want to

855
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,679
understand expectation and acceptance,

856
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,399
you have to put yourself in situations

857
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,760
that are like free from expectation,

858
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,760
and you can't put yourself in a

859
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,720
situation, because the expectation

860
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,080
doesn't come from the situation, right?

861
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,840
It's even... that's... even what 

862
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,240
I said was kind of wrong,

863
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,919
you have to practice messing 

864
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,320
with your expectations, so go to

865
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,679
restaurant just say "Surprise me"

866
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,720
or you can ask if they don't know like

867
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,039
if they're taking it back, you can say

868
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,480
"What's good here?" "Okay I'll take that",

869
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,520
right, if you've got dietary restrictions,

870
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,200
tell them about the dietary restrictions,

871
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,440
and just like... and then you're like "But

872
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,360
what if I don't like the food that I get?",

873
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,760
well yeah, I mean that's the point, right?

874
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,120
So like just eat what 

875
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,640
you get and see what happens,

876
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,320
and they're like "But I don't like it" and

877
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,159
it's like yes, so like pay attention to

878
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,480
that, and be like how hard is it for you

879
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,240
to order food that you're not gonna like

880
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,520
or you order without expectations, what's

881
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,799
it like to go to a restaurant and accept

882
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,320
that you're going to just get some

883
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,760
random pile of food, that could be

884
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,039
amazing and could be 

885
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,440
something that you really dislike,

886
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,279
that's how you gain acceptance, that's

887
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,039
how you let go of expectations, by

888
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,960
literally going to a restaurant and like

889
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,640
actively letting them go

890
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,080
that is the Jnana Yoga,

891
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,760
and then you may discover all kinds of

892
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,159
cool things, right? You may even discover

893
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,799
for example that if you go to the

894
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,960
restaurant and you expect

895
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,480
crap, if you're like "This is going to be

896
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,640
an absolute train wreck, I'm gonna have

897
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,279
to go home and like have a bowl of

898
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,159
cereal after the meal",

899
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,080
it'll be really interesting

900
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,440
how much you enjoy your meal, it'll be

901
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,440
really interesting because in that

902
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,120
moment what you're doing is 

903
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,440
letting go of the expectation, right?

904
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,679
And then like suddenly even if you

905
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,760
get crap it's not a big deal and if you

906
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,919
get something delicious it's like such a

907
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,159
huge win, and that's what it means to let

908
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,919
go of expectation, the more you let go of

909
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,840
expectation, the more you start to enjoy

910
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,360
life and the better life gets,

911
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,799
it's kind of bizarre So literally.

912
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,520
if you guys wanted Jnana

913
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,880
Yoga practice to let go of expectations

914
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,039
and earn acceptance, and you can't just

915
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,640
do this once right, so you can't like

916
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,120
wuss out of it, you have 

917
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,799
to do it for a month,

918
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,399
presuming you're going to go out to eat

919
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,520
you know and you can afford that and all

920
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,520
that good stuff,

921
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,880
otherwise like make it 

922
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,399
three months, like

923
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,720
you know do it for a while like commit

924
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,679
yourself "This is my life now", 

925
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,919
gg get wrecked noobs. So... try it you  

926
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:18,000
guys want to learn Jnana Yoga try it.

927
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,840
Okay, someone else is asking "How should a

928
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,760
parent teacher or manager support the

929
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,279
special needs of gifted people if what's

930
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,000
happening now is bad?" That's a great

931
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,600
question so I'll give you an example,

932
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,240
so sometimes I get parents that come

933
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,240
into my office, they have a kid who's addicted 

934
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,000
to video games "Why is a kid 

935
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,000
addicted to video games?", really simple

936
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,919
because video games match the pace of

937
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,600
the child, right? That's why... that's why

938
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,279
gifted kids in a nutshell, the reason

939
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,600
that gifted kids get addicted to video

940
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,919
games is one very very very simple

941
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,679
reason, can all be reduced to this,

942
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,880
games match the pace of 

943
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,279
the child and school doesn't.

944
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,200
So you've got a kid, goes to school, gets

945
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,880
a worksheet, does the worksheet, I still

946
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,799
remember I... I had this experience. I

947
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,080
skipped the first grade 

948
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,159
so this is what happened,

949
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,919
I went to a school

950
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,679
where you know I'd do a worksheet and

951
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,760
then like they'd give me another one, and

952
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,399
so in in my first day of first grade I

953
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,840
moved schools, I... I gave them... you know... I

954
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,519
got a worksheet, I did the worksheet, I

955
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,200
gave it back to them and I said "Can I

956
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,799
have the next one?" and she's like "What do

957
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,480
you mean the next one?" "It's like the next

958
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,480
one, like whatever's next like, I'm done

959
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,919
with this, we've got class for another forty-five

960
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,760
minutes, I'm done with this, can I have

961
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,919
the next one?" she's like "There is no next

962
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,360
one", I'm like "What?"

963
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,360
and it didn't take long, where like you

964
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,960
know she gave me the... then she evaluated

965
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,159
me and I got moved up a grade, 

966
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,440
but the same problem there

967
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,880
and then eventually like what heck is

968
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,039
like school moves at the pace of like

969
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,559
the slowest person, now here's the really

970
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,320
addictive thing about a video game now,

971
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,159
imagine you're just bored at school,

972
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,360
because it's moving at a snail's pace,

973
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,399
right? Because there's like other

974
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,600
six-year-olds and like you're a

975
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,399
six-year-old too and maybe you're a

976
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,919
little smarter than the other

977
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,519
six-year-olds. Now enter a video game

978
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,559
what happens when you 

979
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,559
don't beat level one?

980
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,159
You replay level one, and what happens

981
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,159
when you beat level one? You go straight

982
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,840
to level two and if you beat level two

983
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,200
you go straight to level three, you beat

984
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,240
level three you go 

985
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,720
straight to level four.

986
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,399
So games perfectly match

987
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,120
the challenge that a human 

988
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,120
being is capable of, right?

989
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,840
If you get stuck on a boss 

990
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,240
in Dark Souls, like

991
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,320
you don't get to move past the boss,

992
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,159
because your parents make a phone call

993
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,760
to FromSoftware and they're like "Hey my

994
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,440
son is really good at video games, can

995
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,200
you please advance him past this boss

996
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,039
and stick him to the next boss?" it's like

997
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,200
you can't do that in Dark Souls, like

998
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,720
Dark Souls doesn't 

999
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,600
care at all, right?

1000
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,320
So like... kids get addicted to video games

1001
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,320
because they perfectly match what you're

1002
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,600
capable of, which is exactly what kids

1003
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,360
like, there's this whole thing called

1004
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,159
"intent to mastery", we teach all this

1005
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,440
stuff to parents and things like that.

1006
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,519
So what do you do if you've got a kid

1007
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,799
who's gifted? You challenge them and you

1008
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,080
don't rely on school to do it for you, 

1009
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,279
so when parents come to me and they're like

1010
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,519
"I have a kid who's addicted to video

1011
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,120
games, he's 16, he thinks school is...", I ask

1012
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,559
him "Okay what do you think about school?"

1013
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,399
like "School is boring!", then what I

1014
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,679
do is... I... you know I make a

1015
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,679
couple of phone calls and I'm like we're

1016
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,120
gonna like you... so we were... I was back

1017
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,960
when I was in Boston, a lot of cool

1018
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,080
startups in Boston, so what I'll do is

1019
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
we'll make some phone calls, we'll stick

1020
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,679
them in an internship somewhere, like

1021
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,519
we'll take some college-level internship,

1022
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,600
it's some kind of startup, so like we'll

1023
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,919
look around at like incubators from like

1024
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,000
M.I.T or whatever, like Harvard, will be

1025
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,440
like "Hey like there's a kid, do you guys

1026
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,440
have any internship opportunities

1027
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,880
available?"" and we'll stick him there and

1028
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,480
he'll like be... he'll work there for the

1029
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,640
summer and it like turns the kid right

1030
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,880
around no more video games, because he's

1031
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,799
actually like learning so I stuck one

1032
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,120
kid in this startup, that was...

1033
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,880
that there's an app, you take a picture

1034
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,480
of a mole on your body and it tells you

1035
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,679
the percentage chance 

1036
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,519
that the mole is cancerous,

1037
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,440
right? So we stick the kid there, 

1038
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,279
we're like "Go help them!"

1039
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,559
and then like sometimes the kid is like

1040
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,080
"What am I supposed to do?", like 

1041
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,159
"You start by getting them coffee

1042
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,000
and then maybe you'll learn something"

1043
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,440
and then it's... it's actually fantastic,

1044
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,799
like they do... they do really well you

1045
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,159
challenge them, right? And because the

1046
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,440
cool thing is that a lot of the startup

1047
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,320
folks they sort of recognize, because

1048
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,440
some of them are like misfits too. So

1049
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,639
they're like "Okay there's like a kid

1050
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,879
here, like let's put them to work" because

1051
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,720
they recognize that "Okay you're sixteen, so

1052
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,560
you know how to like manage SQL data...

1053
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,280
databases?" and the kid is like "No" 

1054
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,480
they're like

1055
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,079
"Google it and learn

1056
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,399
and then you're going to

1057
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,079
manage our SQL database next week"

1058
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,440
and the kid is like "What?" and like "Yeah!"

1059
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,639
and then suddenly the kid is like goes,

1060
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,200
home he's not playing video games, he's

1061
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,560
like reading about 

1062
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,399
SQL databases or whatever,

1063
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,560
right? Just... just stick them... stick them

1064
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,480
into it and challenge them

1065
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,240
so as a parent you know or a teacher,

1066
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,359
like I'd say like ask them so here's the

1067
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,399
biggest mistake that parents and

1068
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,679
teachers make with 

1069
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,000
gifted children, is that you

1070
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,480
when... when a gifted child fails what we

1071
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,480
tend to do is slow down, instead what you

1072
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,879
need to do is speed up, it's absolutely

1073
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,240
terrifying so if a gifted child is

1074
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,560
failing what they need more than

1075
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,480
anything else is a bigger challenge, not

1076
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,760
like an easier environment, now you have

1077
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,640
to make sure for a couple of other

1078
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,720
things, like you need to make sure

1079
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,359
there's not ADHD going, on depression

1080
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,440
going on, learning disabilities or other

1081
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,200
things like that going on, but in the

1082
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,200
absence of all of those things challenge

1083
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,720
them more not less,

1084
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,640
ask them to do more, give them, put them

1085
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,520
in positions of 

1086
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,440
leadership, right?

1087
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,359
And just push them

1088
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,040
because like it's so fulfilling when

1089
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,280
when you're a take a kid in that

1090
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,560
situation and you're like

1091
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,000
"You're gonna need to do this thing" and

1092
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,839
they're like "I can't do that thing" and

1093
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,400
you're like "Okay, so then fail,

1094
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,160
but try if you fail like no big deal, but

1095
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,680
I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna expect less

1096
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,720
of you", I know it's kind of paradoxical

1097
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,400
because we just talked about 

1098
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,160
letting go of expectation,

1099
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,920
but it's not really expectations, it's

1100
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,760
really having faith in them it's a

1101
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,520
subtle difference, but be like "I have

1102
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,440
faith in you I think you can handle it

1103
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,920
so like give it your best shot",

1104
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,200
that's what you do you challenge them,

1105
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,960
respect them, ins... instead 

1106
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,960
of expect things from them.
