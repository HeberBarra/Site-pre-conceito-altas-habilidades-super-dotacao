00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.310
"Ah cara eu amo ser considerada

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.390
uma criança superdotada, eu espero que não

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.950
me torne um perfeccionista... perfeccionista

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.470
burnout... com 

5
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.150
burnout, eu suponho, com depressão,

6
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.230
ansiedade, expectativas vazias e sem 

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.390
interesses ou objetivos reais"

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.070
Isto é algo que alguém

9
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.750
postou no nosso subreddit, vocês sabem

10
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.349
que é um meme. Nós tivemos algumas

11
00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.150
lives sobre burnout e crianças superdotadas

12
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.589
então hoje o que eu gostaria de falar

13
00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.390
um pouco com vocês é sobre

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.630
a trajetória de uma criança superdotada 
para um perfeccionista com burnout,

15
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.030
também como a sociedade

16
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.110
na verdade faz as crianças superdotadas 
meio que fracassarem.

17
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.389
Eu sei que é meio interessante, mas 

18
00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.190
quando pensamos sobre uma criança superdotada,

19
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.430
pensamos sobre... consideramos

20
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.590
a superdotação como uma vantagem,

21
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.189
mas na experiência trabalhando com várias

22
00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.270
crianças superdotadas, não é sempre uma

23
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.630
vantagem e normalmente pode ser um fardo

24
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.990
e tenho visto isso um monte em nossa

25
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.029
comunidade, eu trabalhei com muitas

26
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.029
pessoas que meio que se encaixam nessa

27
00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.990
categoria, suponho que eu talvez me encaixe nisso também.

28
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.390
Onde eu cresci meio que... eu sou superdotado, certo?

29
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.310
Tipo a escola foi fácil para mim,

30
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.270
me contaram desde cedo que eu era inteligente

31
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.149
eu era meio que responsabilizado por tipo...

32
00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.070
não estudar, certo? Nessa época eu 

33
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.710
não estudaria muito

34
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.590
e talvez conseguiria um B+ ou um A-.

35
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.670
E os meus professores falavam 

36
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.030
a mesma coisa para os meus pais nas reuniões,

37
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.390
eles sempre falavam

38
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.830
"Se Alok se aplicasse, ele seria o melhor estudante da turma",


39
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.789
"Se ele apenas estudasse mais ele seria o melhor estudante da turma",

40
00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.910
eles falavam tipo

41
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.550
"Ele é super inteligente, ele tem um monte de potencial"

42
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.990
certo, eles usam palavras tipo...

43
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.670
eles falam sobre o quão inteligente eu sou

44
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.670
eles falam sobre o potencial que eu tenho

45
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.109
e se eu me aplicasse eu seria...
você sabe, eu seria um... eu seria o melhor estudante

46
00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.389
Isso é interessante

47
00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.270
pois consideramos superdotação com uma vantagem, 

48
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.109
mas como uma dos meus professores disse-me,

49
00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.190
falaremos disto mais ao final,

50
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.350
ela me explicou que um...

51
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.670
isto foi na... na... na faculdade de medicina,

52
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.950
mas quando eu estava treinando para ser um psiquiatra,

53
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.709
eu tinha uma supervisora que me contou que

54
00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.950
superdotados... crianças superdotadas são crianças 

55
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.869
de cuidados especias e o que isso
literalmente significa é que:

56
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.510
as necessidades de uma criança que é superdotada

57
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.430
são diferentes de uma criança normal,

58
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.589
e os pais que reconhecem que isso

59
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.830
e reconhecem que essa criança

60
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.710
precisará de uma estrutura diferente, 
um currículo diferente 

61
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.390
ou uma maneira diferente de serem criados,

62
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.710
são os que acabam fazendo um bom trabalho,

63
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.110
e estranhamente na experiência dela,

64
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.869
ela descobriu que assim como qualquer
outra criança de cuidados especiais um...

65
00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.550
você sabe, crianças que não foram...

66
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.470
tratadas apropriadamente, mesmo com a superdotação,

67
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.150
eram os que enfrentavam dificuldades.

68
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.309
Essa afirmação, quando ouvi-a pela primeira vez,

69
00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.750
eu pensei que era absolutamente ridícula,

70
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.430
explodiu um pouco a minha cabeça,

71
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.190
mas eu respeitava muito a supervisora e
comecei a pensar sobre isso.

72
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.710
O que eu gostaria de compartilhar com vocês hoje,

73
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.589
é sobre a trajetória de vida que uma criança superdotada tem,

74
00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.430
como a sociedade trata elas,
como os pais tratam elas,

75
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.270
as dificuldades que elas enfretam

76
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.710
ou as influências que elas têm,

77
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.910
não vamos chamar de dificuldade

78
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.509
porque talvez não seja uma dificuldade,

79
00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.350
e depois como elas terminam.

80
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.630
Eu gostaria de compartilhar com... 
isso com todos vocês hoje, ok?

81
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.149
A primeira coisa que tende a acontecer

82
00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.030
é que quando uma criança é superdotada, elas...

83
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.190
a escola tende a ser fácil, certo?

84
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.430
Se você pensar de maneira desenvolvimental,

85
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.790
tem um monte de coisas que 

86
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.630
acontecem na escola, então vamos falar sobre a escola.

87
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.630
A escola é um lugar onde você consegue...

88
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.550
você socializa, certo? Desenvolve

89
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.710
habilidades de socialização, é um lugar onde

90
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.470
você aprende e as pesam que escola

91
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.990
é primeiramente sobre aprendizado,

92
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.390
e é primeiramente sobre aprendizado, mas não é apenas

93
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.869
sobre aprender as matérias, sim

94
00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.550
aprendemos sobre aritmética e 

95
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.990
matemática e todas essas coisas,

96
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.190
aprendemos história e ciências e todas essas coisas boas,

97
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.390
mas realmente a escola se você olhar para ela de
maneira desenvolvimental é uma oportunidade maravilhosa

98
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.750
para aprender coisas chaves,

99
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.270
socialização  é uma peça importantíssima,

100
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.149
a outra coisa é tipo os hábitos

101
00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.149
e como estudar, que é o primeiro tipo

102
00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.439
de desvantagem, que eu penso que 
as crianças superdotadas enfrentam

103
00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.869
é que sabe se você é muito jovem e 

104
00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.670
é superdotado, escola é tão fácil, que você

105
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.910
passa sem a luxúria de estudar,

106
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.470
nós meio que consideramos isso 

107
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.910
uma vantagem, certo, se você

108
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.429
passa passa pela escola e não estuda,

109
00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.509
tipo é fácil, fácil, facílimo, certo?

110
00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.469
E é assim e faz sentido,

111
00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.990
mas a... a coisa interessante que eu

112
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.150
descobri, é que normalmente ser 

113
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.069
inteligente, especialmente se você é muito jovem,

114
00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.550
na verdade pode te botar na 

115
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.189
rota do fracasso, pois você nunca 

116
00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.510
precisa  aprender o hábito de estudar

117
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.430
que você precisa...

118
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.749
que você precisa para o sucesso mais tarde.

119
00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.189
Para uma criança normal o que tende a acontecer é

120
00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.230
que tipo elas não precisam estudar  na

121
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.440
primeira série, mas talvez tipo na segunda série

292
00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.600
terceira série, elas têm que aprender a

294
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.040
estudar uma vez na semana, talvez elas precisem 

296
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.560
a aprender a esudar na noite antes da

298
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.680
prova porque não vêm tão fácil para elas

302
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.560
e então a quarta quinta série, agora 

304
00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.320
você está... você está fazendo dever de cada alguns

306
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.240
dias da semana, sabe você está estudando dois
ou três dias antes do destes, 

310
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.040
daí você vai para o fundamental 2, 

312
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.800
onde porventura você está estudando quatro dias antes

314
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.280
da prova e então tem esse 

316
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.120
senso gradual de responsabilidade crescente

318
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.800
enquanto vai cada vez mais longe na escola

322
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.280
e é meio que planejado dessa forma, certo?

324
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.840
Nós não somos... tipo 

325
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.840


326
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.360
year old that they're
like giving 14

327
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.360


328
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.600
hours of homework a
week to it's just

329
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.600


330
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.199
absurd and then at
the top end of the

331
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.199


332
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.560
spectrum in terms
of study habits and

333
00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:18.560


334
00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.240
what we demand of
students you have

335
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.240


336
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.759
something like let's
say law school or

337
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.759


338
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.080
medical school or
things like that where

339
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:24.080


340
00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.919
people are regular
studying like 60

341
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.919


342
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.400
hours a week 80 hours
a week in medical

343
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.400


344
00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.320
school because you
know people have have

345
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.320


346
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.400
grown up and have
built enough of a

347
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.400


348
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.320
study habit where
they can actually

349
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.320


350
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.400
handle that pace of study

351
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.400


352
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.720
so what happens with
the gifted kid so

353
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.720


354
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.280
the gifted kid you
know when you sort of

355
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.280


356
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.560
level up your skill
to level one like in

357
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.560


358
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.000
the first grade and
then you level up

359
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.000


360
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.120
your studying skill
to level two in the

361
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.120


362
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.600
second grade and
level three in the

363
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.600


364
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.320
third grade so the
gifted kid never

365
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.320


366
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.000
actually has to like
grind that xp for

367
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.000


368
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.120
levels like one through
five of studying

369
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.120


370
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.280
habits

371
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.280


372
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.120
and so they sort of
managed to get b's

373
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.120


374
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.840
or a's without
really minimal with

375
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.840


376
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.199
minimal studying or
no studying at all

377
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.199


378
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.479
and then seventh
grade rolls around

379
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:02.479


380
00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.000
eighth grade rolls
around they start to

381
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:04.000


382
00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.360
struggle a little bit
maybe they get b's

383
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.360


384
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.280
they're still not
learning how to study

385
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.280


386
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.639
because they sort of
skipped that part

387
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.639


388
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.400
of of the you know
the skill building

389
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:12.400


390
00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.919
and we'll kind of get
to that later and

391
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.919


392
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.360
then what tends to
happen with gifted

393
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:15.360


394
00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.720
kids is that they
don't need to study

395
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.720


396
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.160
don't need to study
don't need to study

397
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.160


398
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.000
and then they hit a wall

399
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.000


400
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.639
they finally get
into some kind of

401
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.639


402
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.240
situation where
their raw intellect

403
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:24.240


404
00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.319
cannot

405
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.319


406
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.000
is no longer sufficient
to handle the

407
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:28.000


408
00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.880
schoolwork that
they're supposed to

409
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.880


410
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.639
handle

411
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.639


412
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.639
but they've trained
themselves at that

413
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:32.639


414
00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.680
point they've customized
themselves at

415
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.680


416
00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.880
that point to managing
school with raw

417
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.880


418
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.479
intellect

419
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.479


420
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.479
and so when that
kind of falls short

421
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:40.479


422
00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:44.000
they like they really
kind of really hit

423
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:44.000


424
00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:45.120
a wall it's a very
very hard cliff to to

425
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.120


426
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.639
overcome

427
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.639


428
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.400
and so this is kind
of the first thing

429
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:48.400


430
00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.479
that that sort of
shoots gifted kids in

431
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.479


432
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.240
the foot and this
also leads to kind of

433
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:52.240


434
00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.599
this idea of perfectionism
and burnout

435
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.599


436
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.039
because then they
like you know then

437
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:55.039


438
00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:56.720
they they struggle
a lot they don't

439
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:56.720


440
00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.160
understand why they
can't do it they

441
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.160


442
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.199
they try they know they're smart

443
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.199


444
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.120
everyone's talking to them about

445
00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:01.120


446
00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:03.120
potential they start
to feel really bad

447
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.120


448
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.880
about themselves so
the first kind of

449
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.880


450
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.199
interesting thing
that gifted kids run

451
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.199


452
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.520
into is the fact that
they sort of don't

453
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:09.520


454
00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:10.720
develop the proper
study habits because

455
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.720


456
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.639
you know as a
six-year-old it's kind of

457
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.639


458
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.080
not your fault because
like you're not

459
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:14.080


460
00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.479
mature enough as a
six-year-old to

461
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.479


462
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.720
realize like oh i
need you know to have

463
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:18.720


464
00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.400
good study habits
so even though the

465
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.400


466
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.599
teacher said this
last tuesday and i

467
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.599


468
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.800
understand that i
don't need to study

469
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:22.800


470
00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:24.240
i'm going to sit down
and like practice

471
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.240


472
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.639
my study habits it
doesn't make any

473
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.639


474
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.560
sense it's like
completely artificial

475
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:28.560


476
00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.639
so that's the first
thing that happens

477
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.639


478
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.720
is that they kind of
hit this wall of of

479
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:32.720


480
00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:34.319
you know not being able to study

481
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.319


482
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.720
the second thing
to consider is the

483
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:36.720


484
00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:38.800
expectation so another
thing that really

485
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.800


486
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.479
leads gifted kids kind
of down the wrong

487
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.479


488
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.639
path is

489
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:42.639


490
00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:44.080
the burden of expectation
that's placed

491
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.080


492
00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:45.440
upon them so from
a very young age

493
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.440


494
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.039
they're told oh
you're gifted you're

495
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.039


496
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.199
smart you're special
you have so much

497
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:49.199


498
00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:52.720
potential and so what
that starts to do

499
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:52.720


500
00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:54.960
is it constructs like
a very very lofty

501
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.960


502
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.639
goal in their minds
right so i'm going

503
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.639


504
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.440
to use kind of an
analogy which is kind

505
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:59.440


506
00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:01.280
of like you know if
i think about an

507
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.280


508
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.440
amazing home like
i think about a

509
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.440


510
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.919
mansion it can have a beautiful

511
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.919


512
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.680
blueprint and i can
buy a gigantic piece

513
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:07.680


514
00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:09.919
of land and i can look
at that and i can

515
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.919


516
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.400
say like oh like this
this home or this

517
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:12.400


518
00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:14.240
this blueprint has
so much potential

519
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.240


520
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.280
and sometimes we
kind of forget that

521
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.280


522
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.400
like

523
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.400


524
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.639
you can have like you can have a

525
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.639


526
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.840
blueprint for a mansion
but that's gonna

527
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:21.840


528
00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:24.479
actually take way
more work to achieve

529
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.479


530
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.000
than like building a
shack so the other

531
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:26.000


532
00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:28.000
really interesting
thing that that we

533
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.000


534
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.240
sort of kind of get
wrong societally is

535
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.240


536
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.759
that we assume that
when someone is

537
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.759


538
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.279
gifted

539
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:33.279


540
00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:35.760
things are actually
going to be easier

541
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:35.760


542
00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:37.919
for them that they
need to work less to

543
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.919


544
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.839
accomplish the same amount

545
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.839


546
00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:42.800
but in my experience
living up to a

547
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:42.800


548
00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:44.720
gifted child's potential
involves more

549
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.720


550
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.080
work it's sort of
like you know it's

551
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.080


552
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.160
just like building
a shack versus

553
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.160


554
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.720
building a mansion
like sure the mansion

555
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.720


556
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.040
is capable of so much
more than the shaq

557
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.040


558
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.040
is capable of but let's
not forget for a

559
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.040


560
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.760
moment that the amount
of effort that it

561
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.760


562
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.680
goes into building a
mansion is actually

563
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.680


564
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.440
way more than what's
required to build a

565
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.440


566
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.880
shack this is the
second place that

567
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.880


568
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.560
gifted kids kind
of get tripped up

569
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.560


570
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.839
because everyone around

571
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.839


572
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.640
is looking at them
and they're sort of

573
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:06.640


574
00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:08.720
saying

575
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.720


576
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.560
oh like this is an
amazing mansion like

577
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.560


578
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.399
you could build such
an amazing mansion

579
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.399


580
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.000
and we all kind of
forget for a moment

581
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:14.000


582
00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:16.160
that like actually
living up to that

583
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.160


584
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.640
potential is very
very difficult and

585
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.640


586
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.880
requires a lot more
of an investment

587
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.880


588
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.200
than building a shack

589
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.200


590
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.279
and so this gap
between what people

591
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.279


592
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.519
expect of you and
also the idea that

593
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:27.519


594
00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:30.160
things should be easier for you

595
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:30.160


596
00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:32.080
kind of compound on
themselves and sort

597
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.080


598
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.680
of end up with
gifted kids kind of

599
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.680


600
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.880
feeling like they're
they're failing at

601
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.880


602
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.399
everything right
because they have all

603
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.399


604
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.000
this potential

605
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:38.000


606
00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:39.360
and they're not they're
just not living

607
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.360


608
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.640
up to it

609
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.640


610
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.880
so the other thing
that we'll see in

611
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.880


612
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.800
gifted kids is that
what what tends to

613
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.800


614
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.640
happen is that they
will put in some

615
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.640


616
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.519
amount of work

617
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.519


618
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.519
but they're expecting
a mansion when

619
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:51.519


620
00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:52.880
all they've really
put in is as much as

621
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:52.880


622
00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:54.240
building a shack

623
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.240


624
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.000
i may have lost you
a little bit there

625
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.000


626
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.720
but let me just explain

627
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.720


628
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.080
so

629
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.080


630
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.600
you know what a
gifted kid will do is

631
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.600


632
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.040
they'll like look at
their peers right

633
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.040


634
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.720
and they'll say like
oh like this person

635
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.720


636
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.399
did this and they're
able to accomplish

637
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.399


638
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.399
this so like i should
be able to do that

639
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:06.399


640
00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:07.600
too and so if you look
at your neighbors

641
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:07.600


642
00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:09.040
who are building a
shack and they're

643
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.040


644
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.519
like whoa they went
to home depot and

645
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.519


646
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.519
they got like 100
pounds of wood and

647
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:13.519


648
00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:15.200
they built their
shack over a weekend

649
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:15.200


650
00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:16.880
and then like you
go and get your 100

651
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.880


652
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.200
pounds of wood from
home depot and you

653
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.200


654
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.680
start like brought
to you by home depot

655
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.680


656
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.600
i suppose um and you
start building your

657
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.600


658
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.279
mansion like i know
it sounds kind of

659
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.279


660
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.720
weird but you know
100 pounds of wood

661
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:26.720


662
00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:28.720
may be enough to build
a shack but it's

663
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.720


664
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.000
nowhere near enough
to build a mansion

665
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.000


666
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.519
and then what gifted
kids will do is

667
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.519


668
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.800
they'll look at like
the foundation that

669
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:32.800


670
00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:34.640
they've laid with a
hundred pounds of

671
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.640


672
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.399
wood and they'll be
like where's the i

673
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.399


674
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.160
don't even have a
shack like you know

675
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:38.160


676
00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:39.519
it's it's like they
look at what they've

677
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.519


678
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.440
accomplished when
they put in the same

679
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:41.440


680
00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:42.880
amount of energy as
someone else and

681
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.880


682
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.880
they get really
confused because this

683
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.880


684
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.560
person has a complete
shack over here

685
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.560


686
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.800
and like i have like barely the

687
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.800


688
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.560
beginnings of a mansion
and so then that

689
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.560


690
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.240
sort of negatively
impacts them they

691
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.240


692
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.680
start to like feel
like they're actually

693
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.680


694
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.040
inferior to these
other people because

695
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.040


696
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.640
they've been told oh
you're smarter than

697
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.640


698
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.160
the kid next door
like why the hell is

699
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.160


700
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.200
the kid next door
getting into college

701
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.200


702
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.360
and like you're not
even getting into

703
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.360


704
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.519
college and so it
all sort of sort of

705
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.519


706
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.200
sort of compounds right
because even for

707
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:05.200


708
00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:06.480
the gifted kid they're
not trying to

709
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.480


710
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.839
build a shack because
they've been told

711
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.839


712
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.240
they've been they're
gifted their entire

713
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:10.240


714
00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:12.079
life so it's not enough
to be average if

715
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.079


716
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.600
you're gifted so what
you have to do is

717
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:13.600


718
00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:15.120
you try to you know
build a mansion

719
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.120


720
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.440
because that's what you've been

721
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.440


722
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.519
told that you're
capable of that's the

723
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.519


724
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.720
expectation you set
for yourself and

725
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:20.720


726
00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:22.240
then you're you're left kind of

727
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.240


728
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.079
scratching your head
and wondering like

729
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.079


730
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.079
why you don't even
have a shack yet even

731
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:26.079


732
00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:27.680
though you studied
for a month and they

733
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:27.680


734
00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:30.000
studied for a month
you're not getting

735
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.000


736
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.440
as much as that they're getting

737
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.440


738
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.640
and it's kind of
super bizarre right

739
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.640


740
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.160
because we don't we
just don't think

741
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.160


742
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.760
about it that way
we think that if

743
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.760


744
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.839
you're gifted that
means that everything

745
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.839


746
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.839
should be easier for
you that it not

747
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:39.839


748
00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:41.360
only they may need a
hundred pounds of

749
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:41.360


750
00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:42.800
wood to build a shack
but you should be

751
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.800


752
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.120
able to build a shack
and 50 pounds of

753
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.120


754
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.680
wood it should be
easier for you but it

755
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.680


756
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.440
turns out paradoxically
being harder

757
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.440


758
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.279
and then we sort of
end up with kind of

759
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.279


760
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.600
the final state of a
gifted kid which if

761
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:53.600


762
00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:55.600
we kind of think about
it internally is

763
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.600


764
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.760
a state of like
really shame and low

765
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.760


766
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.360
self-esteem so all
this stuff kind of

767
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.360


768
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.360
compounds right like
you're told you're

769
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.360


770
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.680
smart so you set
this expectation of

771
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.680


772
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.360
what you're capable
of like way up here

773
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.360


774
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.200
and then like you
know first grade goes

775
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.200


776
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.800
by and you're up here
second grade goes

777
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.800


778
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.320
by and you're up here
third grade goes

779
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.320


780
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.000
by and you're up
here boom boom boom

781
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.000


782
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.480
fourth grade fifth
grade sixth grade

783
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.480


784
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.279
10th grade 11th grade
and then you kind

785
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.279


786
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.560
of tank right and as
you go to college

787
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:18.560


788
00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:20.959
suddenly like you
don't have the study

789
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.959


790
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.440
skills involved and
now in the gap

791
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.440


792
00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:26.240
between what you're
capable of and what

793
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.240


794
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.079
you actually
accomplish this gap is

795
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.079


796
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.639
where shame comes from
this is the shame

797
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:30.639


798
00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:31.440
gap that gifted kids
inevitably fall

799
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:31.440


800
00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:32.959
into

801
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:32.959


802
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.040
which is when they
fall short of what

803
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:35.040


804
00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:36.560
their expectations are
and this could be

805
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.560


806
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.160
once again

807
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.160


808
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.000
due to the fact that
you're you know

809
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.000


810
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.320
you're setting out
to build a mansion

811
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.320


812
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.240
and you ended up not
even building a

813
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.240


814
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.800
shack right so all of these

815
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.800


816
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.399
discrepancies between
your expectations

817
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.399


818
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.720
and your accomplishments

819
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:50.720


820
00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:52.639
in that gap and the
bigger the gap is

821
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.639


822
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.639
the more it's filled with shame

823
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:54.639


824
00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:56.480
so then what happens
is kids are ashamed

825
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:56.480


826
00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:58.320
right because they
should be doing more

827
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.320


828
00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.320
they should be doing better

829
00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.320


830
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.000
and then like the
shame then further

831
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.000


832
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.600
compounds and makes
it hard to find

833
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.600


834
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.360
motivation and this
is where you kind of

835
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.360


836
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.720
get burnout so then
like you have these

837
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.720


838
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.000
gifted kids and you're
like hey man just

839
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.000


840
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.360
like go to a community
college you don't

841
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:09.360


842
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.639
have to go to an
ivy league school

843
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.639


844
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.560
school you don't
have to go to like

845
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:12.560


846
00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:14.880
harvard or stanford
or mit just like go

847
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.880


848
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.720
to your local community
college and in

849
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.720


850
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.320
that comes a bunch
of shame because

851
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.320


852
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.560
you've been told your
entire life that

853
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.560


854
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.959
you're better than that right

855
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.959


856
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.519
and so you start to
develop this ego

857
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:25.519


858
00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:27.760
of being a super smart
kid and then this

859
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:27.760


860
00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:29.440
leads to avoidance of
things because all

861
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.440


862
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.519
you're left with is
the identity of a

863
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.519


864
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.959
smart kid so you can
never even bring

865
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:32.959


866
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:35.680
yourself to go to
community college

867
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:35.680


868
00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:37.519
because smart kids
don't go to community

869
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.519


870
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.360
college in your mind
that's where the

871
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:39.360


872
00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:40.880
stupid kids go and if you go to

873
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:40.880


874
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.720
community college
then suddenly you've

875
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.720


876
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.240
lived your entire
life for 20 years

877
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.240


878
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.680
being told you're a
smart kid it's the

879
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.680


880
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.959
only that's your
biggest strength it's

881
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.959


882
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.720
the one that everyone
keeps talking

883
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:48.720


884
00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:51.360
about and now like
suddenly you have to

885
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.360


886
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.519
relegate yourself to
being a stupid kid

887
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.519


888
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:57.440
and in that gap is
where the shame lives

889
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:57.440


890
00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:59.040
in that gap is where
the ego lives okay

891
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.040


892
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.279
so it's really really
hard right because

893
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.279


894
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.519
you're set up with
these expectations

895
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:03.519


896
00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:05.760
people don't really
acknowledge that

897
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:05.760


898
00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:07.120
because you're capable
of a lot it's

899
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.120


900
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.920
actually going to
take like a lot of

901
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.920


902
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.279
work to take that
potential and bring it

903
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.279


904
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.880
to fruition

905
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:12.880


906
00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:14.480
right and that's like
that's the biggest

907
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.480


908
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.480
thing is people just
lose sight of the

909
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.480


910
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.560
fact that building
a mansion actually

911
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.560


912
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.399
takes more work than
building a shack

913
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.399


914
00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.760
and your entire life
people have told

915
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:21.760


916
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:24.639
you like you should
build this mansion

917
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.639


918
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.000
because that's what
you're capable of

919
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:26.000


920
00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:27.600
and so then we kind
of get to all right

921
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.600


922
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.800
so like what do we
do about it right so

923
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.800


924
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.639
if you're a gifted
kid who's kind of

925
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.639


926
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.720
perfectionistic and
burnt out and like

927
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:32.720


928
00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:33.920
society has sort of
set you up this way

929
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:33.920


930
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.760
i'm not saying that you're not

931
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.760


932
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.760
individually responsible
as well but i

933
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.760


934
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.480
do think that there's
a whole reason so

935
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.480


936
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.880
when we have like a
generation of burnt

937
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.880


938
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.639
out gifted kids i
think we have to be

939
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.639


940
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.399
fair and be a little
bit scientific and

941
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:46.399


942
00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:48.720
kind of acknowledge
that this may not be

943
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:48.720


944
00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:50.639
like an individual
problem right we've

945
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.639


946
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.240
got a generation of
kids like this like

947
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:52.240


948
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:54.880
maybe there's something
societal going

949
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.880


950
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.839
on and i think
paradoxically we sort of

951
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.839


952
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.120
set these kids up to

953
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:59.120


954
00:14:56.839 --> 00:15:01.360
struggle and so
then the question

955
00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.360


956
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.480
becomes okay like what
do we do about it

957
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:02.480


958
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.480
so the first thing
you should do if

959
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.480


960
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.440
you're a gifted kid is to stop

961
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.440


962
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.199
comparison right like
comparison is is

963
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.199


964
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.240
the foundation of
getting out of this

965
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:10.240


966
00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:11.920
problem

967
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.920


968
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.680
because as long as
you are comparing

969
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.680


970
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.120
yourself and this is
part of the issue

971
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.120


972
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.320
is that if you think
about the word

973
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:16.320


974
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.399
gifted

975
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.399


976
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.800
what does the word
gifted imply it is a

977
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:20.800


978
00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:23.199
word that has no meaning

979
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.199


980
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.199
outside of a comparative
framework you

981
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:25.199


982
00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:27.040
guys get that the
only way you can be

983
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:27.040


984
00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:28.639
gifted is if there
are other people who

985
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.639


986
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.560
are not gifted

987
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:30.560


988
00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:33.920
and so essentially
what happens is like

989
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.920


990
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:36.800
the whole idea of
a gifted kid only

991
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.800


992
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.639
exists in relationship
to another kid

993
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.639


994
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.720
and so what we find
in the minds of

995
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:40.720


996
00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:42.399
gifted kids is that
they're comparing

997
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.399


998
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.759
themselves all the
time oh i don't want

999
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:43.759


1000
00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:45.600
to go to community
college that's where

1001
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:45.600


1002
00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:47.040
the stupid people
go oh i don't know

1003
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.040


1004
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.199
like why i can't do
what my friend is

1005
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.199


1006
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.040
capable of like he's
able to do so much

1007
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:51.040


1008
00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:53.759
why am i not able to
do so much i have

1009
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.759


1010
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.079
an older sibling
who did fantastic

1011
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:56.079


1012
00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:58.079
and now i have big
shoes to fill right

1013
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:58.079


1014
00:15:56.079 --> 00:16:01.040
there's so much
comparison all of the

1015
00:15:58.069 --> 00:16:01.040


1016
00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:02.720
expectations that
gifted kids have don't

1017
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.720


1018
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.560
come from themselves

1019
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.560


1020
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.880
right because if you
actually based your

1021
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.880


1022
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.800
expectations on what
you're capable of

1023
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:10.800


1024
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.240
you'd be capable
of a b c d or an f

1025
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.240


1026
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.480
that's what that
would be a realistic

1027
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.480


1028
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.320
expectation but instead
you create these

1029
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.320


1030
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.399
artificial expectations
that are based

1031
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.399


1032
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.360
on comparison and why
do gifted kids do

1033
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:19.360


1034
00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:21.600
that because it
starts with their

1035
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.600


1036
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.839
parents it starts
with their teachers

1037
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.839


1038
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.079
we're all told that
we're gifted which

1039
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:26.079


1040
00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:27.680
is by definition a
comparison to all of

1041
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:27.680


1042
00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:28.800
the other kids

1043
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.800


1044
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.720
and so then what
happens is you're

1045
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.720


1046
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.560
looking over at the
shack and you've got

1047
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.560


1048
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.160
this blueprint for
a mansion and they

1049
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.160


1050
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.519
give you some wood
and then you try to

1051
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.519


1052
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.440
build the mansion
and like you don't

1053
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:37.440


1054
00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:39.120
even have a roof when
this person has a

1055
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.120


1056
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.800
completely built shack
and then you kind

1057
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.800


1058
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.880
of look at yourself
well like man i must

1059
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.880


1060
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.800
be like a super idiot
right like and

1061
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.800


1062
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.240
it's just it's so
bizarre that when we

1063
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.240


1064
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.320
set up this kind of
when we start with

1065
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.320


1066
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.240
this framework of a comparison

1067
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.240


1068
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.000
we sort of doom
ourselves to failure

1069
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.000


1070
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.759
because there's like we're just

1071
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.759


1072
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.920
it's just it's never
going to work

1073
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:55.920


1074
00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:58.240
because you can't ever

1075
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.240


1076
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.920
base the expectations
of your life and

1077
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.920


1078
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.600
what you're capable
of based on what

1079
00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.600


1080
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.759
someone else is doing

1081
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.759


1082
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.520
right if someone else
is happy studying

1083
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:05.520


1084
00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:06.799
chemical engineering
it doesn't mean

1085
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.799


1086
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.039
that you're going to
be happy studying

1087
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:09.039


1088
00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:10.799
chemical engineering
if somebody else is

1089
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:10.799


1090
00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:11.839
happy dating someone
of the opposite sex

1091
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:11.839


1092
00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:14.160
it doesn't mean that
you're going to be

1093
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.160


1094
00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:16.000
happy dating someone
of the opposite sex

1095
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.000


1096
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.240
the whole point is
as individuals as

1097
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.240


1098
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.520
humans we're individuals
and if you're a

1099
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.520


1100
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.360
gifted kid the first
thing you've got to

1101
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.360


1102
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.839
do is let go of all comparison

1103
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.839


1104
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.079
so next thing is to

1105
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.079


1106
00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:29.919
recognize that your
road is going to be

1107
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.919


1108
00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:32.559
a rough one right so
like when someone

1109
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:32.559


1110
00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:34.400
sets out to build a
mansion they know in

1111
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:34.400


1112
00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:35.840
their mind that like
this is gonna take

1113
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:35.840


1114
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.480
a while right

1115
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.480


1116
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.919
you can't expect to
build a mansion in

1117
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:39.919


1118
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.520
the same amount of
time it would take

1119
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:41.520


1120
00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:43.120
someone to build a shack

1121
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.120


1122
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.520
and so if you're a
gifted kid and you

1123
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.520


1124
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.640
expect a lot from yourself

1125
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:46.640


1126
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.240
okay

1127
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.240


1128
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.799
recognize that this
is going to be a

1129
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.799


1130
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.960
long road and the
greater your potential

1131
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:52.960


1132
00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:54.640
is the longer it's
going to take for you

1133
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.640


1134
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.720
to get there and this
is something that

1135
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.720


1136
00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.360
i can understand in
hindsight like so i

1137
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.360


1138
00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.840
grew up as a gifted
kid and was like in

1139
00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.840


1140
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.600
you know the special
classes or whatever

1141
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.600


1142
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.760
i actually still
remember when i was in

1143
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.760


1144
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.480
eighth grade my
grades started to dip

1145
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.480


1146
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:11.440
and when i went to high school

1147
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.440


1148
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.200
um i didn't qualify
for based on my

1149
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.200


1150
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.120
grades like my high
school was like yeah

1151
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.120


1152
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.799
he needs to be in
like regular english

1153
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.799


1154
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.840
he can't be in like
advanced english or

1155
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:17.840


1156
00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:19.919
he doesn't meet the criteria for

1157
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.919


1158
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.280
advanced english and
so my parents were

1159
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:21.280


1160
00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:22.880
really really not
happy with that

1161
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.880


1162
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:25.120
because they have they
have such a smart

1163
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.120


1164
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.559
boy you know he's so
smart he just needs

1165
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.559


1166
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.919
to apply himself so
they went to the

1167
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:27.919


1168
00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:30.000
school and i remember
having a meeting

1169
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:30.000


1170
00:18:27.919 --> 00:18:31.600
with the the honors
english teacher or

1171
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.600


1172
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.799
whatever and then
he's like do you want

1173
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.799


1174
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.919
to be in this class
and i was like yeah

1175
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:33.919


1176
00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:35.679
i want to be in the
class and my parents

1177
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:35.679


1178
00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:37.520
were like yeah he
should be he belongs

1179
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:37.520


1180
00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:38.880
he belongs in the class

1181
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.880


1182
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.720
right and so the
teacher was like okay

1183
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.720


1184
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.240
fine because you know

1185
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.240


1186
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.600
i mean you're not
gonna you know there

1187
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.600


1188
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.679
are some parents that
could potentially

1189
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.679


1190
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.960
be annoying so
you're like whatever

1191
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:46.960


1192
00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:48.400
and so i ended up
being in the class

1193
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.400


1194
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.760
that i really didn't
belong and i really

1195
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.760


1196
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.880
didn't do very well

1197
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:50.880


1198
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.679
right because i
didn't have the work

1199
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.679


1200
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:56.799
ethic but it propagates
sort of this

1201
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:56.799


1202
00:18:53.679 --> 00:18:58.799
idea of like you can handle it

1203
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:58.799


1204
00:18:56.799 --> 00:19:00.880
so like i started off
you know going on

1205
00:18:58.789 --> 00:19:00.880


1206
00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:02.320
the wrong track kind
of like in in high

1207
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.320


1208
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.000
school it took me

1209
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.000


1210
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.760
i took me five years
to graduate from

1211
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.760


1212
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.600
college right with a 2.5 gpa

1213
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.600


1214
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.840
took me another three
or four years to

1215
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.840


1216
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.559
even get into medical school

1217
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.559


1218
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.400
and so like my
road has been long

1219
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:16.400


1220
00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:18.640
and like that's just
sometimes what it

1221
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.640


1222
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.720
takes if you're a
gifted kid right you

1223
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.720


1224
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.640
take the scenic route in life so

1225
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.640


1226
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.440
oftentimes people
would ask me you know

1227
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:23.440


1228
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.720
like

1229
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.720


1230
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.320
about stuff

1231
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.320


1232
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.840
when i remember when
i was going to when

1233
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.840


1234
00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.360
i started medical
school and i saw

1235
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.360


1236
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.559
friends of mine right
who were who i was

1237
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.559


1238
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.799
in high school with
they're already

1239
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:32.799


1240
00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:34.240
fully trained doctors
and you know

1241
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:34.240


1242
00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:35.280
flying around and
all that good stuff

1243
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.280


1244
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.400
and i'm just like
starting medical

1245
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.400


1246
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.039
school and i was
like yeah i took the

1247
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.039


1248
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.720
scenic route in life
and so recognize

1249
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:40.720


1250
00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:42.240
that if you're a
gifted kid like it's a

1251
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.240


1252
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.080
long road like you're
not going to do

1253
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.080


1254
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.280
things faster you're
not going to build

1255
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.280


1256
00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.280
a mansion

1257
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.280


1258
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.799
as fast as someone
else is going to

1259
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.799


1260
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.799
build a shack the other thing to

1261
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:50.799


1262
00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:53.600
recognize about it
being a long road if

1263
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:53.600


1264
00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:56.480
you're a gifted kid
is don't expect to

1265
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.480


1266
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.520
see the form of your
mansion for a long

1267
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:57.520


1268
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.039
time

1269
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.039


1270
00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.120
when other people
have built their

1271
00:19:59.029 --> 00:20:01.120


1272
00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:03.440
shacks you will
still just have the

1273
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.440


1274
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.960
foundation of the
mansion it's not going

1275
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:04.960


1276
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.480
to have a roof for a
long time it's not

1277
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.480


1278
00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.679
going to have windows
for a long time so

1279
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.679


1280
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.960
this is the other
problem that gifted

1281
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:08.960


1282
00:20:07.679 --> 00:20:11.200
kids run into

1283
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.200


1284
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.440
is as they put in
an equal amount of

1285
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.440


1286
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.760
effort compared to
their colleagues they

1287
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.760


1288
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.400
actually see less
return on their

1289
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.400


1290
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.080
investment and that
in turn shatters

1291
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.080


1292
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.280
their motivation and
what makes them

1293
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.280


1294
00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.559
want to give up

1295
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.559


1296
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.480
right because i'm
putting in all this

1297
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:24.480


1298
00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:26.640
effort i'm still not
seeing anything yet

1299
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.640


1300
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.159
so it's a long road
be patient with

1301
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.159


1302
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.240
yourself and try
your best not to

1303
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:30.240


1304
00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:32.000
compare to other people

1305
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.000


1306
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.240
the last thing to
kind of consider is

1307
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.240


1308
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.760
that is the shame so gifted kids

1309
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.760


1310
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.360
oftentimes struggle a lot with

1311
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.360


1312
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.120
self-esteem and
shame and that once

1313
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.120


1314
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.200
again is because their
expectations are

1315
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.200


1316
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.720
up here and their
performance is down

1317
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.720


1318
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.200
here right

1319
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.200


1320
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.640
and so in that gap
is where your shame

1321
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:46.640


1322
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.640
is going to live

1323
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.640


1324
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.400
and so as long as there
is a gap in what

1325
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.400


1326
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.880
you expect from yourself

1327
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.880


1328
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.280
with what you accomplish

1329
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.280


1330
00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.039
you will have shame
and the solution to

1331
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.039


1332
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.840
that oddly enough
is one of two ways

1333
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.840


1334
00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:59.679
right

1335
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.679


1336
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.360
one is you can actually

1337
00:20:59.669 --> 00:21:01.360


1338
00:20:59.679 --> 00:21:03.280
live up to the
expectations that you

1339
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.280


1340
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.120
have right so you can
actually shoot up

1341
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.120


1342
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.440
here and land up here
so you can go to

1343
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.440


1344
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.200
an ivy league school
or whatever right

1345
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.200


1346
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.120
you can go you can start

1347
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.120


1348
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.559
you can do a tech
startup or whatever

1349
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.559


1350
00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.480
like you can like

1351
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:14.480


1352
00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:16.000
do everything that
everyone has always

1353
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.000


1354
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.080
known you're capable
of doing so you can

1355
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.080


1356
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.080
actually hit all of
those metrics that's

1357
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.080


1358
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.080
one option then the
shame will go away

1359
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.080


1360
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.600
or what you can do
is let go of your

1361
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.600


1362
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.679
expectations

1363
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.679


1364
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.240
and bring yourself
down here because the

1365
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:28.240


1366
00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:30.720
shame exists in the
gap so even if you

1367
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.720


1368
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.280
accept yourself as
being like sort of a

1369
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.280


1370
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:36.400
failure oddly enough
the shame will go

1371
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.400


1372
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:39.039
away and as you accept
yourself as you

1373
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.039


1374
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.120
are which is not
wasted potential but

1375
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:41.120


1376
00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:42.720
like in the present like you are

1377
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.720


1378
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.320
everything that
you're capable of

1379
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.320


1380
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.320
everything that you've
ever been capable

1381
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.320


1382
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.720
of is exactly what
you've achieved and

1383
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.720


1384
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.960
once you sort of
take that attitude

1385
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.960


1386
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.799
bring your expectations
down to here you

1387
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.799


1388
00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.320
will be amazed at
like what happens to

1389
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:54.320


1390
00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:55.679
your motivation and
what you are truly

1391
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.679


1392
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.600
capable of

1393
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:57.600


1394
00:21:55.679 --> 00:22:00.159
but you can't achieve
it as long as

1395
00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:00.159


1396
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.039
there is that shame
gap right like in

1397
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:03.039


1398
00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:03.039
terms of performance

1399
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.000
so questions

1400
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.000


1401
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.240
anyway so let me just
kind of summarize

1402
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.240


1403
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
so i think that like

1404
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.000


1405
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.520
you know we see this
a lot where a lot

1406
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.520


1407
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.280
of people are gifted

1408
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.280


1409
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.280
and we think of that
as an advantage but

1410
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.280


1411
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.720
like i was saying earlier

1412
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.720


1413
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.440
i think that

1414
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.440


1415
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:24.240
you know sometimes
being gifted comes

1416
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.240


1417
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:26.240
with its own set of needs

1418
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.240


1419
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.600
and by properly
addressing those needs

1420
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.600


1421
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.679
we can avoid some of
these things like

1422
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.679


1423
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.080
gifted kids you know
feeling ashamed of

1424
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:32.080


1425
00:22:29.679 --> 00:22:34.559
themselves gifted kids

1426
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.559


1427
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.480
you know not like
comparing themselves

1428
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:36.480


1429
00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:38.720
to like all the other
normal kids and

1430
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.720


1431
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.880
and finding themselves lacking

1432
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.880


1433
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.559
um and also that
we have to kind of

1434
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:42.559


1435
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.880
acknowledge that our
school system is

1436
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:44.880


1437
00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:47.600
sort of set up in a
particular way that

1438
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.600


1439
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.440
oftentimes causes
gifted kids to stumble

1440
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.440


1441
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.679
and through understanding
like how a

1442
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.679


1443
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.840
gifted kid you know
a child who is

1444
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:53.840


1445
00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:55.919
gifted becomes an adult who's

1446
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.919


1447
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.679
perfectionistic and burnt out

1448
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:57.679


1449
00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:59.520
we have to understand
that whole life

1450
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:59.520


1451
00:22:57.679 --> 00:23:03.120
cycle in order to sort of

1452
00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.120


1453
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.120
start taking steps to change it

1454
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.400
um

1455
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.320
okay so i'm sure
you've been asked this

1456
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:12.320


1457
00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:14.720
question before and
have answered before

1458
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.720


1459
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.480
so feel free to
tell me where i can

1460
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.480


1461
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.919
finally answer this
question how are you

1462
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:17.919


1463
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.360
able to get accepted
to harvard medical

1464
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:19.360


1465
00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:21.919
school let alone
medical school alone

1466
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.919


1467
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.679
with such a low gpa
when that is such a

1468
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:23.679


1469
00:23:21.919 --> 00:23:25.039
critical deciding factor

1470
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:25.039


1471
00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:27.760
how did i stand out
so that's a great

1472
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:27.760


1473
00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:29.679
question so the short
answer is so i i

1474
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.679


1475
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.159
did some amount of
graduate education so

1476
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:32.159


1477
00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:33.600
i did a master's
degree to boost my gpa

1478
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:33.600


1479
00:23:32.159 --> 00:23:36.000
the second thing that
i did i didn't go

1480
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.000


1481
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.400
to harvard for medical
school i went to

1482
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.400


1483
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.320
tufts for medical
school and then i did

1484
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.320


1485
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.960
my psychiatry training
at harvard at

1486
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.960


1487
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.640
mass general mclean hospital

1488
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.640


1489
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.559
and so the short
answer of like how i

1490
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.559


1491
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.520
wound up there is
like one step at a

1492
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:47.520


1493
00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:49.679
time

1494
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.679


1495
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:53.279
so you have to do
you know in each of

1496
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:53.279


1497
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:53.279
those things involved like

1498
00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.840
a reality check
or some degree of

1499
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.840


1500
00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.240
humility in terms of
like thinking like

1501
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.240


1502
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.520
i actually don't
belong at harvard like

1503
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.520


1504
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.440
i'm never going to
wind up there i had

1505
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.440


1506
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.720
to accept that right
let alone get into

1507
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:04.720


1508
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.559
medical school

1509
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.559


1510
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.080
and the more that i
accepted like i i

1511
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:10.080


1512
00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:12.159
did a lot of things
that were you know

1513
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.159


1514
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.080
humbling to say the
least i wouldn't

1515
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:14.080


1516
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:16.000
quite say undignified
but i had to

1517
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.000


1518
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.760
really let go of a
lot of ego and like

1519
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.760


1520
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.919
take one step at a
time it also took

1521
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.919


1522
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.200
perseverance i mean
i applied to 120

1523
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:21.200


1524
00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:23.279
medical schools
before i got into a

1525
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.279


1526
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.159
single one and that
was the break that i

1527
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:24.159


1528
00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:26.000
needed

1529
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:26.000


1530
00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:28.880
and then like
understanding having all

1531
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.880


1532
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.039
that failure behind me i really

1533
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.039


1534
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.520
worked hard in medical school

1535
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:33.520


1536
00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:35.840
and really tried to excel

1537
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.840


1538
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.279
and then i actually
did an away rotation

1539
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.279


1540
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.600
for those of you don't
know what that is

1541
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:39.600


1542
00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:41.520
or for those of you
do know what that is

1543
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.520


1544
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.640
so i basically did
an audition rotation

1545
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.640


1546
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.320
at harvard which is like super

1547
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.320


1548
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.600
competitive you show
up there with a

1549
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.600


1550
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.919
bunch of other people
who want to go

1551
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.919


1552
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.520
there and it's
basically like a test

1553
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:49.520


1554
00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:52.000
it's like a month-long
test of what

1555
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.000


1556
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.840
you're capable of and
i did really well

1557
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.840


1558
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.159
so thankfully i had
set up you know a

1559
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.159


1560
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.279
lot of good stuff over the last

1561
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:57.279


1562
00:24:56.159 --> 00:24:59.600
eight years

1563
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:59.600


1564
00:24:57.279 --> 00:25:01.120
in terms of being
myself and like owning

1565
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.120


1566
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.960
the person that i
was and not being

1567
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.960


1568
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.720
ashamed of the
fact that i failed

1569
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.720


1570
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.400
and you know recognizing
that most of

1571
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.400


1572
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.240
the students most of
the other students

1573
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.240


1574
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.080
who were auditioning

1575
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.080


1576
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.840
um were four years
younger than i was

1577
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.840


1578
00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.440
that i was actually
older than some of

1579
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.440


1580
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.880
the residents there

1581
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:14.880


1582
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.880
despite the fact
that like they were

1583
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.880


1584
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.960
evaluating me right
so like there's

1585
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.960


1586
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.400
someone two years
younger who's like

1587
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.400


1588
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.919
giving me a grade

1589
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.919


1590
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.840
so navigating all that stuff was

1591
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:23.840


1592
00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:25.679
difficult but i did a
good job at it and

1593
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.679


1594
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.440
stayed focused and
that's how i wound up

1595
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:27.440


1596
00:25:25.679 --> 00:25:30.880
at harvard so i trained
there for four

1597
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.880


1598
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.880
years and that's where
i'm faculty now

1599
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.279
right but it's all
about like letting go

1600
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.279


1601
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.279
of the ego

1602
00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:49.520
um how do you lower expectations

1603
00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:54.240
uh you lower expectations
by accepting

1604
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.240


1605
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.679
what you're capable of

1606
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.679


1607
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.600
like actually and so
expectation and and

1608
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:59.600


1609
00:25:57.679 --> 00:26:00.880
acceptance are at
opposite ends of the

1610
00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:00.880


1611
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.919
spectrum

1612
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:01.919


1613
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.919
okay so

1614
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:03.919


1615
00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:05.279
practicing acceptance

1616
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:05.279


1617
00:26:03.919 --> 00:26:07.840
is

1618
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:07.840


1619
00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:09.600
how you lower expectations

1620
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.600


1621
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.440
so let me give you
guys an example so

1622
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.440


1623
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.440
the theme today is

1624
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.440


1625
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:16.559
right so like let me
think about a nyani

1626
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.559


1627
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.799
yoga exercise to let
go of expectations

1628
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:18.799


1629
00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:18.799
um

1630
00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:25.080
let me just think
about this for a

1631
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.080


1632
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.080
second

1633
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.880
so here's a good example
of a nyani yoga

1634
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:32.880


1635
00:26:31.679 --> 00:26:34.240
exercise actually i
don't know if this

1636
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.240


1637
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.840
is a good example

1638
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:35.840


1639
00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.600
this is one of the
ones that i feel less

1640
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.600


1641
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.679
confident this is maybe
a bad example of

1642
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.679


1643
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.120
a yoga exercise

1644
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:41.120


1645
00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:42.960
so for the next

1646
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.960


1647
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.720
month or two months

1648
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.720


1649
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.720
when you go to a restaurant

1650
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.960
and someone asks you
what you want to

1651
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:50.960


1652
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.000
want what you want
to order just tell

1653
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:54.000


1654
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.080
the waiter to surprise you

1655
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.080


1656
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.320
just tell them surprise me

1657
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.320


1658
00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:01.760
and then pay attention

1659
00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.760


1660
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:04.400
to your enjoyment or
lack of enjoyment

1661
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.400


1662
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.880
of the food

1663
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.880


1664
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:09.120
right so when we
go to restaurants

1665
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.120


1666
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.720
we have expectations
and if we think

1667
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.720


1668
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.559
about the least

1669
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.559


1670
00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.640
the worst experience
that you can have

1671
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:14.640


1672
00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:15.840
at a restaurant is
not actually to have

1673
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:15.840


1674
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.080
bad food

1675
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.080


1676
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.520
it's to expect really
good food and get

1677
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.520


1678
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.799
bad food that's
actually worse than

1679
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:20.799


1680
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.480
getting bad food if you know a

1681
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:22.480


1682
00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:23.600
restaurant is crap
and you go there and

1683
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.600


1684
00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.440
you order something
the food that you

1685
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.440


1686
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.279
get is crap like what
were you expecting

1687
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.279


1688
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.720
it's totally fine
actually right we do

1689
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:28.720


1690
00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:30.480
that every day like
if you go to a fast

1691
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.480


1692
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.799
food like mcdonald's
or taco bell or

1693
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.799


1694
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.320
whatever like you're
not expecting you

1695
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:34.320


1696
00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:36.480
know like a gourmet
meal you're just

1697
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.480


1698
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.080
expecting some like
mediocre arguably

1699
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.080


1700
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.120
incredibly tasty

1701
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.120


1702
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.799
depending on whether
you're getting a

1703
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.799


1704
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.159
mexican pizza or not

1705
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:42.159


1706
00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:43.279
which you can't get
anymore because

1707
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:43.279


1708
00:27:42.159 --> 00:27:44.240
they're out of

1709
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:44.240


1710
00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:45.039
sad

1711
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.039


1712
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.960
but

1713
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:46.960


1714
00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:48.559
so like a lot of if
you guys want to

1715
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.559


1716
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.320
really understand
so this is the way

1717
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:50.320


1718
00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:53.600
that nyanio works if
you really want to

1719
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.600


1720
00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:55.679
understand expectation
and acceptance

1721
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:55.679


1722
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.399
you have to put
yourself in situations

1723
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:58.399


1724
00:27:55.679 --> 00:27:59.760
that are like free
from expectation

1725
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:59.760


1726
00:27:58.399 --> 00:28:01.760
and you can't put yourself in a

1727
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.760


1728
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.720
situation because
the expectation

1729
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.720


1730
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.080
doesn't come from
the situation right

1731
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.080


1732
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.840
it's even that's

1733
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.840


1734
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.240
even what i said
was kind of wrong

1735
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.240


1736
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.919
you have to practice

1737
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.919


1738
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:14.320
messing with your
expectations so go to

1739
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:14.320


1740
00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:15.679
restaurant just say surprise me

1741
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.679


1742
00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.720
or you can ask if
they don't know like

1743
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:16.720


1744
00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:19.039
if they're taking
it back you can say

1745
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.039


1746
00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.480
what's good here
okay i'll take that

1747
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:20.480


1748
00:28:19.039 --> 00:28:23.520
right if you've got
dietary restrictions

1749
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.520


1750
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.200
tell them about the
dietary restrictions

1751
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.200


1752
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.440
and just like and
then you're like but

1753
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.440


1754
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.360
what if i don't like
the food that i get

1755
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.360


1756
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.760
well yeah i mean
that's the point right

1757
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.760


1758
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.120
so like just eat
what you get and see

1759
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.120


1760
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.640
what happens

1761
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.640


1762
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.320
and they're like but
i don't like it and

1763
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.320


1764
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.159
it's like yes so like
pay attention to

1765
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.159


1766
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.480
that and be like how
hard is it for you

1767
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:40.480


1768
00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:42.240
to order food that
you're not gonna like

1769
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.240


1770
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.520
or you order without
expectations what's

1771
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.520


1772
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.799
it like to go to a
restaurant and accept

1773
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:46.799


1774
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.320
that you're going
to just get some

1775
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:48.320


1776
00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:49.760
random pile of
food that could be

1777
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.760


1778
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.039
amazing and could be
something that you

1779
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.039


1780
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.440
really dislike

1781
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:53.440


1782
00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:55.279
that's how you gain
acceptance that's

1783
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.279


1784
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.039
how you let go of
expectations by

1785
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:57.039


1786
00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:58.960
literally going to a
restaurant and like

1787
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:58.960


1788
00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:00.640
actively letting them go

1789
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.640


1790
00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.080
that is the nyani yog

1791
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.080


1792
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.760
and then you may
discover all kinds of

1793
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.760


1794
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.159
cool things right you
may even discover

1795
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.159


1796
00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.799
for example that
if you go to the

1797
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:08.799


1798
00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:10.960
restaurant and you expect

1799
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:10.960


1800
00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:12.480
crap if you're like
this is going to be

1801
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.480


1802
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.640
an absolute train
wreck i'm gonna have

1803
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.640


1804
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.279
to go home and like
have a bowl of

1805
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.279


1806
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:20.159
cereal after the meal

1807
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:20.159


1808
00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:22.080
it'll be really interesting

1809
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:22.080


1810
00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:23.440
how much you enjoy
your meal it'll be

1811
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.440


1812
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.440
really interesting
because in that

1813
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.440


1814
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.120
moment what you're
doing is letting go

1815
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.120


1816
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.440
of the expectation

1817
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.440


1818
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.679
right and then like
suddenly even if you

1819
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.679


1820
00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.760
get crap it's not a
big deal and if you

1821
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:33.760


1822
00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:35.919
get something delicious
it's like such a

1823
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:35.919


1824
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.159
huge win and that's
what it means to let

1825
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:38.159


1826
00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:39.919
go of expectation the
more you let go of

1827
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:39.919


1828
00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:41.840
expectation the more
you start to enjoy

1829
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:41.840


1830
00:29:39.919 --> 00:29:43.360
life and the better life gets

1831
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.360


1832
00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.799
it's kind of bizarre

1833
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.799


1834
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.520
so literally if you
guys wanted nyani

1835
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:47.520


1836
00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:48.880
yoga practice to let
go of expectations

1837
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.880


1838
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.039
and earn acceptance
and you can't just

1839
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.039


1840
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.640
do this once right
so you can't like

1841
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:52.640


1842
00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:55.120
wuss out of it

1843
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.120


1844
00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.799
you have to do it for a month

1845
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:56.799


1846
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.399
presuming you're going
to go out to eat

1847
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:58.399


1848
00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:59.520
you know and you can
afford that and all

1849
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:59.520


1850
00:29:58.399 --> 00:30:01.520

1851
00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.520

it three months

1853
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.880


1854
00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.399
like

1855
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.399


1856
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.720

while like commit

1863
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.840

try it

1866
00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.880
okay someone else is
asking how should a

1867
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:26.880


1868
00:30:24.799 --> 00:30:29.760
parent teacher or
manager support the

1869
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:29.760


1870
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:31.279
special needs of gifted
people if what's

1871
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.279


1872
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.000
happening now is
bad that's a great

1873
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:34.000


1874
00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:35.600
question so i'll
give you an example

1875
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.600


1876
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.240
so sometimes i get
parents that come

1877
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.240


1878
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.240
into my office

1879
00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:41.919
they have a kid who's
addicted to video

1880
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:41.919


1881
00:30:39.919 --> 00:30:44.000
games why is a kid
addicted to video

1882
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:44.000


1883
00:30:41.919 --> 00:30:46.000
games really simple

1884
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.000


1885
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.919
because video games
match the pace of

1886
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:47.919


1887
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.600
the child right
that's why that's why

1888
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:49.600


1889
00:30:47.919 --> 00:30:51.279
gifted kids in a
nutshell the reason

1890
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:51.279


1891
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.600
that gifted kids get
addicted to video

1892
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:53.600


1893
00:30:51.279 --> 00:30:55.919
games is one very
very very simple

1894
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:55.919


1895
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.679
reason can all be
reduced to this

1896
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:57.679


1897
00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:58.880
games match the pace
of the child and

1898
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:58.880


1899
00:30:57.679 --> 00:31:01.279
school doesn't

1900
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:01.279


1901
00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.200
so you've got a kid
goes to school gets

1902
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:03.200


1903
00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:04.880
a worksheet does the
worksheet i still

1904
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.880


1905
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.799
remember i i had
this experience i

1906
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:06.799


1907
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.080
skipped the first
grade so this is what

1908
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:08.080


1909
00:31:06.799 --> 00:31:10.159
happened

1910
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.159


1911
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.919
i went to a school

1912
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:11.919


1913
00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:13.679
where you know i'd
do a worksheet and

1914
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:13.679


1915
00:31:11.919 --> 00:31:15.760
then like they'd give
me another one and

1916
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:15.760


1917
00:31:13.679 --> 00:31:18.399
so in in my first day
of first grade i

1918
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.399

and it didn't take
long where like you

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.360


1941
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.960

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.159


1957
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.360
because it's moving
at a snail's pace

1958
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:51.360


1959
00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:52.399
right because there's like other

1960
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.399


1961
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.600
six-year-olds and like you're a

1962
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:53.600


1963
00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:54.399
six-year-old two
and maybe you're a

1964
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.399


1965
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.919
little smarter than the other

1966
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:57.919


1967
00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:59.519
six-year-olds now
enter a video game

1968
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:59.519


1969
00:31:57.919 --> 00:32:00.559
what happens when you
don't beat level

1970
00:31:59.509 --> 00:32:00.559


1971
00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:02.559
one

1972
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:02.559


1973
00:32:00.559 --> 00:32:04.159
you replay level one
and what happens

1974
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:04.159


1975
00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:06.159
when you beat level
one you go straight

1976
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:06.159


1977
00:32:04.159 --> 00:32:07.840
to level two and if
you beat level two

1978
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:07.840


1979
00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:09.200
you go straight to
level three you beat

1980
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.200


1981
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.240
level three you go
straight to level

1982
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.240


1983
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.720
four

1984
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.720


1985
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.399
so games perfectly match

1986
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.399


1987
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:17.120
the challenge

1988
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:17.120


1989
00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:19.120
that a human being
is capable of right

1990
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.120


1991
00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.840
if you get stuck on a
boss in dark souls

1992
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.840


1993
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.240
like

1994
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:22.240


1995
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.320
you don't get to
move past the boss

1996
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.320


1997
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:26.159
because your parents
make a phone call

1998
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.159


1999
00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.760
to from software and
they're like hey my

2000
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:27.760


2001
00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:29.440
son is really good
at video games can

2002
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.440


2003
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.200
you please advance
him past this boss

2004
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.200


2005
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.039
and stick him to the
next boss it's like

2006
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:33.039


2007
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.200
you can't do that
in dark souls like

2008
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:35.200


2009
00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:36.720
dark souls doesn't give a

2010
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.720


2011
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.600
right

2012
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:39.600


2013
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:42.320
so like kids get
addicted to video games

2014
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.320


2015
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.320
because they perfectly
match what you're

2016
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:44.320


2017
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.600
capable of which is
exactly what kids

2018
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.600


2019
00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.360
like there's this
whole thing called

2020
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.360


2021
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:50.159
intent to mastery
we teach all this

2022
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:50.159


2023
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.440
stuff to parents and
things like that

2024
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:51.440


2025
00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:53.519
so what do you do
if you've got a kid

2026
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:53.519

00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:56.799

don't rely on school
to do it for you so

2030
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:58.080


2031
00:32:56.799 --> 00:32:59.279
when parents come to
me and they're like

2032
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:59.279


2033
00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.519

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:42.880


2081
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.480
of a mole on your
body and it tells you

2082
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:44.480


2083
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.679
the percentage chance
that the mole is

2084
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:45.679


2085
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.519

and then like sometimes
the kid is like

2092
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:52.559


2093
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:54.080

2095
00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:56.159
by getting them coffee

2096
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.159


2097
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.000
and then maybe you'll
learn something

2098
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:58.000


2099
00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:59.440

00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:02.159


2105
00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:03.440
cool thing is that a
lot of the startup

2106
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:03.440


2107
00:34:02.159 --> 00:34:06.320
folks they sort of
recognize because

2108
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:06.320


2109
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.440
some of them are
like misfits too so

2110
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.440


2111
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.639

here like let's put
them to work because

2114
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:10.879


2115
00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:12.720
they recognize that
okay you're 16. so

2116
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:12.720


2117
00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:14.560

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:14.560


2119
00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.280
databases and the kid
is like no they're

2120
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:15.280


2121
00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.480
like

2122
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.480


2123
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.079
google it

2124
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:18.079


2125
00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.399
and learn and then
you're going to

2126
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:20.399


2127
00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:22.079
manage our sql
database next week

2128
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:22.079

and then suddenly the
kid is like goes

2132
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:24.639


2133
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:27.200

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:28.560
like reading about sql databases

2136
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:28.560


2137
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.399
or whatever

into it and challenge them

2142
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.480


2143
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.240
so as a parent you
know or a teacher

2144
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:36.240

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:37.359


2147
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:40.399
biggest mistake that parents and

2148
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:40.399


2149
00:34:37.359 --> 00:34:41.679
teachers make with
gifted children

2150
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:41.679


2151
00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:44.000
is that you

2152
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:44.000


2153
00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:46.480
when when a gifted
child fails what we

2154
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:46.480


2155
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.480
tend to do is slow
down instead what you

2156
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:48.480


2157
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.879
need to do is speed
up it's absolutely

2158
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:50.879


2159
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.240
terrifying so if a
gifted child is

2160
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:52.240


2161
00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:54.560
failing what they need more than

2162
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:54.560


2163
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.480
anything else is a
bigger challenge not

2164
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.480


2165
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.760
like an easier
environment now you have

2166
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:57.760


2167
00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.640
to make sure for a
couple of other

2168
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:58.640


2169
00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.720
things like you
need to make sure

2170
00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.720


2171
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:03.359
there's not adhd
going on depression

2172
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.359


2173
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.440
going on learning
disabilities or other

2174
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:05.440


2175
00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:07.200
things like that
going on but in the

2176
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.200


2177
00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.200
absence of all of those
things challenge

2178
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:09.200


2179
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.720
them more not less

2180
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:10.720


2181
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.640
ask them to do more
give them put them

2182
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.640


2183
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.520
in positions of leadership

2184
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:13.520


2185
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.440
right

2186
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.440


2187
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.359
and just push them

2188
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:17.359


2189
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.040
because like it's
so fulfilling when

2190
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:19.040


2191
00:35:17.359 --> 00:35:21.280
when you're a take a kid in that

2192
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:21.280


2193
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.560
situation and you're like

2194
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:22.560


2195
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.000
you're gonna need to
do this thing and

2196
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:24.000


2197
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.839
they're like i can't
do that thing and

2198
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.839


2199
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.400
you're like okay so then fail

2200
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:28.400


2201
00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:30.160
but try if you fail
like no big deal but

2202
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:30.160


2203
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.680
i'm not gonna i'm not
gonna expect less

2204
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.680


2205
00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.720
of you i know it's
kind of paradoxical

2206
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:32.720


2207
00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.400
because we just talked
about letting go

2208
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:34.400


2209
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.160
of expectation

2210
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.160


2211
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.920
but it's not really
expectations it's

2212
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:37.920


2213
00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.760
really having faith
in them it's a

2214
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.760


2215
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.520
subtle difference
but be like i have

2216
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.520


2217
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.440
faith in you i think
you can handle it

2218
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:45.440


2219
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:47.920
so like give it your best shot

2220
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:47.920


2221
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.200
that's what you do
you challenge them

2222
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:49.200


2223
00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:53.960
respect them

2224
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:53.960


2225
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.960
is instead of expect
things from them

2226
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.240
you
